# Foreword

According to A. A. Zalizniak's "Grammatical Dictionary of the Russian Language", adjectives constitute about 22% of Russian vocabulary. This is in some sense a unique result (both for the Russian language and for adjectives). The dictionary is characterized by a significant quantitative predominance of nouns – it is they that define the vast diversity of objects in extralinguistic reality. I will not take on the responsibility of comparing the "class power" of Russian and, say, English adjectives (a task difficult to accomplish in itself). Russian, however, systematically uses adjectives in a number of cases where, for example, English or French resort to nouns (cf. `kirpich` / `kirpichnyy` vs. brick; `London` / `londonskiy` vs. de Londres). There is no doubt: if a "world championship of adjectives" were held among languages, Russian would certainly be among the world leaders. Does this mean that languages which "lag behind" in such a virtual competition lack words? Of course not.

A bit more comparison: each of the 72 African languages (of various genetic affiliations) studied in (Segerer 2008) contains fewer than 30 adjectives. Can this fact characterize such languages as "primitive" or "underdeveloped"? The author is confident that it cannot. These languages are not only not primitive, but with their help, any ideas expressible in the languages of Europe or Asia can be conveyed. These ideas will simply be expressed using other grammatical means.

What happens if a language lacks some grammatical means familiar to native speakers of Russian or English? And what happens if such a grammatical instrument exists, but is structured completely differently? In this book, I will try to answer this question by comparing adjectives in Russian, English, and other languages more familiar to us, with data from more "exotic," i.e., simply less known and familiar, languages.

However, as I will try to show, in its "exoticism," at least in the domain of adjectives, Russian can well compete with many less-studied languages. Besides the vastness of its lexical domain, Russian adjectives are characterized by a wide coverage of grammatical phenomena typologically associated with adjectives. Some of these phenomena, most important for understanding the nature of adjectives, will be analyzed using Russian data.

The underlying idea of this book was to accompany the theoretical study of adjective grammar with examples of detailed analysis of specific phenomena in individual languages. The most detailed coverage is given to Russian, Ossetian, a number of Altaic, and Nakh-Dagestanian languages. For illustrative purposes, material from other world languages is used (see List of Languages).

I will say a few words about the structure and organization of the work. The monograph includes four chapters. Chapter 1 will discuss the typology of adjectives and the typological bases for identifying adjectives as a separate class. Chapter 2 – key for this book – will be dedicated to a detailed analysis of adjective syntax and the morphological structure of the adjective wordform. In Chapter 3, we will turn to a question not often posed by researchers – the ability of adjectives to introduce participants in the situations they define. Chapter 4 will describe models for the formation of units with adjective distribution, which include more than one stem. A brief Conclusion will summarize the main results.

All second-level sections (1.1, etc.) are provided with summaries. This is done for readers who prefer to first find out what a long (and sometimes boring) discussion led to, and only then spend their time familiarizing themselves with it (the author certainly counts himself among them).

Some terminological remarks: the term "noun" will correspond to a substantive noun. The adjective, which in some grammatical traditions is included in the general class of nouns, will not a priori be considered a member of this class. I will also avoid the labels "qualitative" and "relational" when referring to adjectives. In the course of the discussion, the concepts of "adjective" and "attributive" will be formulated and defined, which to a certain extent correspond to the traditional division into "qualitative" and "relational" adjectives. One of the goals of the undertaken research was to shed light on the typological and syntactic nature of "qualitativeness" and "relationality".

The book includes the results of research in the grammar of adjectives that I have conducted over the past 20 years. During this time, I was supervised and myself provided scientific guidance, participated in joint projects, expeditions, and worked in various academic institutions. I am grateful to all the people with whom I had the opportunity to work for the experience and knowledge gained.

The scientific direction within which this book and my other works are written can best be defined as "syntactic typology". For choosing this direction, in which I once felt comfortable and in which I continue to be interested, I must thank two people.

A taste and interest in typology were instilled in me by Aleksandr Evgenievich Kibrik during expeditions, my studies at OTiPL (Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics), and in the process of scientific communication. One could say that after defending my diploma under Aleksandr Evgenievich's supervision, I embarked on "free navigation" and began to study linguistics independently. However, at a certain point while working on the book, I realized with surprise that, despite all the new "background" I had acquired, a number of Kibrik's scientific ideas held absolute preference. One such idea, which became fundamental for my proposed approach to adjectives, is the idea of (categories of) attributiveness and stativity, suggested by Aleksandr Evgenievich during the analysis of Dagestanian language data.

The second component of the scientific direction I once chose – syntax – was acquired under the influence of Ekaterina Anatolyevna Lyutikova. I vividly remember the moment when my choice in favor of syntax was made once and for all. This happened during preparation for my first expedition. To Katya's question about what I intended to do, I replied something (I don't quite remember what exactly).

In response, I heard: "But that's not syntax! That's not so interesting..." Since then, I have tried to engage only in syntax (even when I was doing morphology). And it has always been interesting to me, and I have never once regretted my choice. I hope that Katya, whose help and support have been with me all this time, also has no regrets. (And I hope syntax does too.)

Some sections of the book are based on the results of collaborative work on writing scientific articles, preparing reports, courses, or participating in joint scientific projects, for which I must thank A. E. Grashchenkova, I. M. Kobozeva, O. F. Krivnova, G. I. Kustova, E. A. Lyutikova, V. A. Plungyan.

A number of colleagues have strongly influenced my views on various issues related to the book's subject matter, primarily: N. Madariaga, V. Markman, O. Matushansky, J. Bailyn, D. Pesetsky, Ya. G. Testelets, S. G. Tatevosov, S. S. Sai – I would like to express my sincere gratitude to them.

I am grateful to all staff members of the Department of Languages at the Institute of Oriental Studies for fruitful scientific discussions, help in finding linguistic material, as well as for their support and the pleasure of working together; I am especially grateful to Z. M. Shalyapina, V. M. Alpatov, A. G. Belova, A. V. Kostyrkin, T. G. Pogibenko, E. L. Rudnitskaya, O. V. Stolbova.

I am also grateful for discussions on specific aspects of the problems addressed in the book to I. A. Nevskaya, V. Yu. Apresyan, E. V. Delikanova, O. V. Kuryanova, P. S. Pleshak, N. M. Abovyan, A. A. Serebryannikova. I also thank all my informants for their patience, time spent, and responsible attitude towards an activity whose meaning was not always clear to them (a feeling, I confess, I sometimes shared myself).

Some of the problems discussed in this book were investigated by me – independently or in co-authorship – in previous works. However, in preparing this monograph, I tried to formulate a more precise understanding of all the issues included in the book. Some ideas were revised, a number of hypotheses rejected, and a number of new ones put forward instead. Thus, the most current and accurate – from my point of view – ideas about the grammatical nature of adjectives and related problems are formulated by me in this book, and not in my previous works.

I sincerely hope that the main ideas of the book will be understandable to linguists from different schools of thought, with varying educational backgrounds and research experience. If the reader still feels that they need more information about the theoretical apparatus of this book, I would recommend (Testelets 2001; Mitrenina et al. 2012; Lyutikova 2017a) as an introduction to modern syntactic theory and (Plungyan 2011) as a source of information on the typology of grammatical categories.

# Chapter 1. Adjectives in the System of Parts of Speech

## 1.1. Parts of Speech

## 1.1.1. Parts of Speech: Why Do We Need Them?

"Adjective" is a term describing a part of speech. Consequently, if we are interested in adjectives, it is necessary to understand what parts of speech (hereinafter – PoS) are and why they are needed.

Even those unfamiliar with typology might have pondered the following problems. Why are adjectives `golodnyy` / hungry used in Russian and English, while in French or Agul, nouns `faim` / `gaš` 'hunger' correspond to these adjectives:

- (1) Ya byl goloden.
    'I was hungry.'
- (2) English
    I was hungry.
- (3) French
    J'avais faim.
    'I was hungry.', lit.: 'I had hunger.'
- (4) Agul (Maysak 2014: 270)
    Za-s ʡ aji gaš kːe.
    I-DAT very hunger be:PRES
    'I was very hungry.', lit.: 'To me was hunger.'

To continue the analogies – why is there no adjective for `khotet' pit'` 'to be thirsty' 1 in Russian, while English, alongside `hungry`, consistently uses the adjective `thirsty`, and French, just as consistently, uses the noun `soif` 'thirst', analogous to `faim` 'hunger'?

1 There is Old Church Slavonic `zhazhdushchiy`, but besides being a participle, it is also clearly stylistically marked.

Another example of such discrepancies can be the absence in some languages of adjectives like Russian `kamennyy`. If French resorts to a prepositional phrase in this case, English and Turkic languages use an unmarked noun combination:

(5) French
maison en / de pierre
house in / from stone

(6) English
stone house

(7) Bashkir
tash yort
stone house
'stone house'

Even from these quite specific examples, it is clear that the boundary between parts of speech varies across languages. The situation with adjectives in this regard is particularly notable: in some languages, it is difficult to identify an independent class of adjectives.

Thus, the World Atlas of Language Structures (wals.info) indicates that for a sample of 138 languages, in 77 languages (56%), attributive adjectives are inflected differently from nouns and verbs. In the remaining 61 languages (44%), adjectives in attributive roles are to some extent aligned with nouns (i.e., require the same inflection as a possessor) and/or verbs (are encoded as a relative clause) (Gil 2013).

Thus, the distribution of lexemes into PoS is not universal and does not replicate precisely across all languages. However, as we will see, the situation is far from chaotic. While exact overlap of PoS boundaries across different languages is not to be expected, there is, however, something that unites all languages – a (to some extent) universal set of contexts for lexeme usage.

It can also be said that the inventory of major lexical PoS, among which nouns and verbs are primarily distinguished, followed by – as less universal – adjectives, and then adverbs, is more or less recognized by all linguists, see, for example, (Schachter, Shopen 2007). We will discuss specific complex cases a bit later.

The problem of identifying PoS is generally considered by linguists from one of two perspectives. The first is the descriptive linguistics viewpoint: in a language, there is a certain number of words, each of which must be assigned to one class or another. Such a problem statement naturally assumes that we have a clear idea of what a word is, where the boundaries between words and non-words lie, and so on. In this book, we will not specifically address this issue, although we will encounter the opposition between word and phrase, for example, when discussing compound adjectives in Russian and attributive complexes in some other languages. The descriptive approach to parts of speech is often applied when describing grammars of specific languages (though not exclusively in this context). Such an approach stems from the needs of a dictionary: we are faced with a multitude of elements that need to be classified in some way. Such a classification, besides a purely taxonomic purpose, has another task: to describe the properties of word classes realistically, as it is impossible to describe each specific word individually.

On the other hand, there is a view of PoS as building blocks for constructing utterances and their parts. From this perspective, individual words or even word groups may not be important. What is important, first and foremost, are those elements (variables) that combine with others according to regular rules and make the most productive contribution to the production of utterances in a given language. Below, we will examine both approaches, defining the first as descriptive and the second as procedural.

## 1.1.2. From the History of Study

Here we will very briefly present the history of views on parts of speech; for more details, see (Desnitskaya, Katsnelson 1980; Alpatov 1986; 1990). The first observations known to us (and, apparently, quite vague) about the fact that words in a language are not uniform and can differ, for example, in the forms they take, are found in the Babylonian tradition as early as the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, see (Desnitskaya, Katsnelson 1980: 17-37).

Aristotle (384-322 BC) distinguished nouns, verbs, conjunctions, and articles. For the first time in the European tradition, PoS were divided by Aristotle into meaningful (lexical) and meaningless (functional). For meaningful nouns and verbs, the criteria for opposition are not entirely clear. On the one hand, the opposition was based on morphology; on the other hand, Aristotle tended to identify the verb with the predicate, i.e., to rely on the syntactic functions of PoS (Ibid.: 172).

Aristotle's identification of individual linguistic "atoms" was far from the modern understanding of PoS. For example, the enumerated verb, noun, functional PoS, and case all fell into one classification row. The Stoics (4th-2nd centuries BC) were the first to consistently address the task of identifying PoS. PoS according to the Stoics included proper nouns, common nouns, verbs, conjunctions, and articles, the latter encompassing pronouns and articles of Ancient Greek. By conjunctions, the Stoics understood both conjunctions and prepositions, and some Stoics also added adverbs to the categories listed above, see (Ibid.: 190-192).

The system of PoS presented in Dionysius Thrax's "Grammar" (170 BC - 90 BC) would persist in the European tradition for quite a long time. Dionysius distinguished nouns, verbs, participles, articles (determiners), pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions. The noun was represented by 24 categories, including proper and common nouns, adjectives, kinship terms, generic and specific names, etc. (Ibid.: 217-218).

As we can see, Dionysius distinguished the participle as a separate part of speech, while the adjective, conversely, belonged to a subclass of nouns. This classification would remain in the European tradition for a long time. For example, in M. V. Lomonosov's "Russian Grammar," we find the following PoS: "Thus the human word has eight meaningful parts. 1) Noun, for naming things. 2) Pronoun, for abbreviating names. 3) Verb, for naming actions. 4) Participle, for abbreviation, by connecting a noun and a verb into one utterance. 5) Adverb, for briefly depicting circumstances. 6) Preposition, for indicating the belonging of circumstances to things or actions. 7) Conjunction, for depicting the reciprocity of our concepts. 8) Interjection, for briefly expressing movements of the spirit" (Lomonosov 1755: 26).

All the approaches listed above should rather be classified as descriptive. However, surprisingly, a consistently procedural approach is at least as old (and possibly older). Panini, an Indian grammarian who presumably lived in the 4th century BC, compiled a grammatical description containing about 4000 rules (sutras). Using these rules, all grammatical wordforms of the Sanskrit variant contemporary to Panini could be constructed. It is generally believed that Panini's main objective was actually the construction of all possible utterances, i.e., syntactic derivation (Sharma 2002: 51-52). The construction of wordforms was an important task for two reasons: i) Sanskrit morphophonology is quite complex (Voloshina 2016), ii) correct wordform construction is a necessary stage in sentence construction.

Panini introduced a large number of tools that were "discovered" by linguistics much later: null units; the principle of preferring the more specific over the more general; he proposed his own metalanguage with variables and rules for their combination, etc., see (Sharma 2002; Voloshina 2010). One of Panini's most important achievements is the formulated notion that the verb sets the "scene of action," and the noun specifies the agents of the action corresponding to that scene. Based on this, Panini distinguishes verbal and nominal stems, `dhātu` and `prātipadika` (respectively), see (Voloshina 2010: 163). Since "Panini's grammar is mainly focused on describing the procedure of formal synthesis" (Voloshina 2017: 152), Panini realized that it is necessary to distinguish units that are formed by different rules and play different roles in the formation of an utterance 2.

2 Note that Indian grammarians anticipated both L. V. Shcherba's `glokaya kuzdra` and N. Chomsky's "colorless green ideas". The Russian pseudo-sentence `Glokaya kuzdra shteko budlanula bokra i kudryachit bokrenka`, like the English "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously", attests to the independence of the grammatical (syntactic) component from semantics. Indeed, we do not doubt the grammaticality of each of these sentences and can even provide them with some interpretation, despite the fact that both are meaningless. In the Indian tradition, there also existed a grammatically correct utterance whose units do not semantically combine with each other: `Idet syn besplodnoy zhenshchiny s nebesnym tsvetkom v volosakh, omytym molokom cherepakhi, nesushchey luk iz roga krolika` (Sharma 2002: 50). 'A barren woman's son is coming with a celestial flower in his hair, washed with tortoise milk, carrying a bow made of rabbit horn.'

Next, we will present modern views on the identification of PoS and the problems linguists face in solving this task.

## 1.1.3. Principles of PoS Identification

### 1.1.3.1. Basic Functions of PoS and Their (Un)markedness

The identification of PoS is the division of lexemes into classes based on some criterion. If we were to build a classification solely on morphological criteria, nouns of different declensions and verbs of different conjugations could be assigned to different PoS. Conversely, uninflected nouns like `zhuri` 'jury', `metro` 'metro' and adverbs `vchera` 'yesterday', `vskore` 'soon', etc., could be assigned to the same part of speech. Using the morphological criterion, it is not difficult for us to identify natural classes of lexemes, but there would be quite many of these classes.

Let us also note another type of error: the "abuse" of the morphological criterion did not allow the authors of grammars of Ancient Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit to identify adjectives as a separate class. Indeed, adjective inflection in these languages was the same as that of nouns.

The syntactic criterion is also associated with known difficulties. The use of the syntactic criterion could be based on the idea that the basic function of verbs should be to denote action, i.e., to perform the role of a predicate. The basic function of a noun is to fill the position of terms with the predicate (let us recall Panini's metaphor of the scene and participants of the action). What is the place of adjectives in this dichotomy? On the one hand, adjectives can replace terms, cf.: `Zato razyaznyy kletchatyy sam otrekomendovalsya findirektoru…` 'But the unconstrained plaid one himself introduced himself to the finance director…' from M. A. Bulgakov's "The Master and Margarita". On the other hand, it was already clear to the authors of the Port-Royal Grammar (1660) that the adjective is a hidden predicate. In the phrase "Dieu invisible a créé le monde visible" 'Invisible God created the visible world', A. Arnauld and C. Lancelot saw three predications: 1) God is invisible; 2) God created the world; 3) the world is visible, see (Arnauld, Lancelot 1998: 130). Thus, the adjective (and indeed, the noun) functions as a predicate similar to a verb.

A third criterion that could be useful for identifying PoS is semantic. According to the semantic criterion, nouns should denote names of objects, and verbs – names of actions. The shortcomings of this approach are known: words like `beg` 'running' or `dozhd'` 'rain' denote actions, while verbal derivatives like `lyubimyy` 'beloved' or `pokupatel'` 'buyer' denote objects. It is indeed difficult to identify some invariant meaning for all nouns, on the one hand, and for all verbs, on the other. One such attempt is the universal semantic inventory proposed in (Wierzbicka 1999), the so-called concept of semantic primitives. According to it, the most characteristic, prototypical representatives are identified for each PoS. The part-of-speech affiliation of all other lexemes is determined by which prototypical unit they combine with in terms of their morphosyntactic properties; see also the development of this approach in (Dixon 2004).

An interesting version of the semantic approach was developed by A. M. Peshkovsky (1878-1933). Peshkovsky proposed that each PoS possesses its own "grammatical meaning": nouns – the meaning of substantiality, verbs – the meaning of action, etc. Such a "meaning" is primarily related to grammar, not semantics, cf.: "`chtenie` – an object in our grammatical thought" (Peshkovsky 2001: 129). This grammatical meaning is not determined by the (morphological) form of the word, but is expressed by the forms of word combinations. For example, the categorical meaning of substantiality manifests in a noun's ability to: 1) agree with an adjective; 2) function as a complement to another noun, verb, and preposition (i.e., is governed by them when it is a possessor, an object in a verb phrase, or dependent on a preposition); 3) be a subject to a verb; 4) not agree with another noun (as is the case with adjectives); 5) be incompatible with an adverb (Peshkovsky 2001: 64-67). It appears that in the concept of grammatical meaning, Peshkovsky anticipated the idea of semantic types in formal semantics or categories in Combinatory Categorial Grammar.

Over the long history of language study, linguists have managed to consider all possible bases for part-of-speech classifications. In modern traditional grammars, a "complex" definition is adopted, taking into account morphological, syntactic, and semantic criteria for identifying PoS, cf.: "An adjective is a part of speech denoting a non-processual attribute of an object and expressing this meaning in inflectional morphological categories of gender, number, and case. The adjective possesses the morphological category of degree of comparison and has full and short forms" (AG-80-1: § 1294). The purpose of such a complex definition is most likely twofold. With a disjunctive reading of the definition, "maximum coverage" of all possible lexical units is expected, and with a conjunctive reading, the most precise indication of the most characteristic representatives of the class. The emergence of such complex definitions is further evidence that even within a single language, there are significant discrepancies in the properties of units of the same PoS.

The problem of the universality of PoS also has another aspect: can a particular language have PoS characteristic only of it (or of a narrow range of languages)? For example, L. V. Shcherba proposed to combine lexemes with different morphology, including `nel'zya` 'impossible', `mozhno` 'possible', `nado` 'necessary', `pora` 'time', `zhal'` 'pity', … `kholodno` 'cold', `svetlo` 'light', `veselo` 'merry', …, as well as short adjectives and units like `navesele` 'tipsy', `nagotove` 'ready', … into a common "category of state" characteristic of the Russian language (Shcherba 1974: 85, 86). The question of the relevance of the category of state as a PoS for Russian and other languages remains debatable.

The approach to PoS identification adopted in modern typology is based on the concept of markedness, see (Hopper, Thompson 1984; Thompson 1988; Testelets 1990; Croft 1991; Bhat 1994; Beck 2002; Dixon 2004) and other works. Typologists distinguish unmarked (= not receiving special inflection) and marked (= receiving such inflection) uses of lexical units. A transition from one PoS to another, from the perspective of markedness, corresponds to recategorization or decategorization (conversion).

Recategorization is the (morphologically or analytically) marked transition of a lexical unit, which in its unmarked use belonged to lexical class A, into lexical class B. For example, the use of an English adjective in predicate position can be considered marked. English adjectives can function as a predicate in one of two cases: i) if they become verbs as a result of inflection with corresponding derivational markers, ii) if they are used with a copula:

(8) English
(internet)
- a. The music softens the manners.
- b. His manners were soft.

Morphemes marking the transition from one part of speech to another are of two types. The first type of recategorizing affixes depends on the part-of-speech affiliation of the stem to which it attaches. For example, the Russian suffix `-sk` primarily attaches to nouns, forming adjectives with various semantics, cf.: `gorod-skoy` 'city-ADJ', `lyudoed-skiy` 'cannibal-ADJ', `lyubitel'-skiy` 'amateur-ADJ', etc. Recategorizing morphemes of the second type, so-called transcategory morphemes, can attach to stems of units of any PoS. For example, the Tatar suffix `-lau` can form verbs from nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, cf.: `agu` 'poison', `agulau` 'to poison'; `vak` 'small', `vaklau` 'to crush'; `kabat` 'repeatedly', `kabatlau` 'to repeat'.

Decategorization or conversion refers to the morphologically unmarked use of one part of speech in the function of another. One of the most regular types of conversion in the domain of adjectives is the formation of attributes from nouns denoting material, cf. English: `stone wall` (lit.: stone wall), Tatar `agach kyuper` 'wooden bridge' (lit.: tree bridge).

The first consistent application of markedness theory to PoS is presented in (Croft 1991). W. Croft proposes to introduce three semantic types of lexemes: objects, properties, and actions. Objects are represented in language by nouns, properties by adjectives, and actions by verbs 3. These three types of lexical units correspond to three basic functions: reference, modification, and predication. For each type of lexeme (= each PoS), there is an unmarked and a marked usage. Unmarked usage of nouns corresponds to reference, unmarked usage of adjectives to modification, and verbs to predication.

3 Of course, it would be appropriate here to recall A. M. Peshkovsky's idea, specifying that nouns correspond to "objects" or have the meaning of substantiality, adjectives to "properties" or have the meaning of quality, and verbs to "actions" or have the meaning of verbality.

The use of a lexeme in a certain function may or may not be accompanied by marking. In particular, the use of lexemes in a non-inherent function may (but is not obliged to) be additionally marked. Thus, the use of nouns may be marked or unmarked in the function of modification and predication, the same applies to properties in the function of reference and predication, and actions in the function of reference and modification. An example of marked use of a PoS in a non-inherent function is given above for the English adjective `soft`, and of unmarked use for the English noun `stone` or the Tatar `agach`.

According to Croft, the following condition must hold in all languages: the use of a certain PoS in its basic function cannot be more marked than its use in a non-inherent function. For example, the English noun `stone` should not be used unmarked in the appositive noun phrase `stone wall` and at the same time be marked in contexts like `Somebody threw a stone`.

A conceptually similar approach to PoS is found in (Baker 2003). The formal-syntactic paradigm, represented by M. Baker, initially only postulated the division of lexemes into main lexical classes (Chomsky 1957). In (Chomsky 1970), a slightly improved system of opposition was introduced, based on combinations of the features [+/-N] and [+/-V], defining nouns as [+N,-V], verbs as [-N,+V], adjectives as [+N,+V], and prepositions as [-N,-V]. This approach helped to "feel out" common properties, for example, of verbs and prepositions (ability to govern, [-N]) or to explain why verbs and adjectives in some languages can form a single PoS (both have the [+V] feature). However, it can be said that the question of the ontological status of different PoS and the reasons for dividing lexemes by part-of-speech criteria was to a certain extent secondary for generative linguistics. Works proposing an understanding of the existing PoS system were, as a rule, related to the status of functional projections, i.e., functional PoS and/or grammatical categories, see, for example, (van Riemsdijk 1998; Grimshaw 2000).

Baker attempted to represent Croft's functionally-oriented approach in terms of formal linguistics. According to (Baker 2003), nouns differ from verbs and adjectives in that they have the ability to denote a referent or, in Baker's terminology, contain a referential index. Verbs, unlike nouns and adjectives, can be predicates. Syntactically, this is related to the fact that only verbs can project a specifier position (subject). For nouns and adjectives to become predicates, they must first combine with a syntactic unit that has its own specifier, typically a functional projection Pred or a verb. Adjectives, according to Baker, are defined negatively: they cannot contain a referential index and do not project their own specifier.

Concluding the discussion of PoS in formal language models, let's mention the approach in (Pesetsky, Torrego 2004). The formal system proposed by D. Pesetsky and E. Torrego bases differences in PoS properties on different representations of the temporal feature in different lexemes, leading to different combinatorial properties. Verbs, nouns, and adjectives can take complements of various types. Using a metaphor from physics, verbs in Pesetsky and Torrego's system can be represented as "positively charged" (with a temporal feature) elements, nouns as "negatively charged," and adjectives as temporally neutral. In the monograph (Pesetsky 2013), based on Russian data, individual grammatical categories (lexical and functional projections) are effectively equated with cases: D - nominative, N - genitive, V - accusative, P - oblique cases.

An important problem for the theory of PoS is the set of grammatical categories (hereinafter – GC) characteristic of each specific PoS (in a particular language). According to (Croft 1991; Bhat 1994; Beck 2002; Baker 2003) and others, the typological space of GC possibilities for individual PoS looks like this:

(9) PoS and Grammatical Categories

| PoS             | Grammatical Categories                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nouns           | number, countability, case, gender, size (diminutive / augmentative), form (numeral classifiers), definiteness, alienability (in expressing possessiveness)                                                                                          |
| Adjectives      | degrees of comparison (comparative, superlative, …), intensity of attribute, attributive agreement with noun, secondary predication                                                                                                                 |
| Verbs           | tense, aspect, mood, modality, agreement with subject / direct object / other arguments and circumstantials, transitivity                                                                                                                         |

The list above presents the typological space of possibilities for various PoS. A complete set of all relevant GCs is, naturally, rarely present in any particular language. If a certain language has any GC for a certain PoS, it will most likely be in this list next to that PoS.

Morphological variation in the inflection of PoS by indicators of various categories is quite significant. This can be seen even in the example of nominal categories in geographically and genetically close Indo-European languages of Europe. For example, the GC of noun case has disappeared in most Romance and Germanic languages (remaining in some, such as Romanian and Icelandic), but has been preserved in most Slavic languages (but disappeared, for example, in Bulgarian). At the same time, the category of definiteness has developed in most Western European languages, which, however, has not affected most Slavic languages, and so on.

Such diversity of GCs, which makes the application of the morphological criterion problematic, is contrasted with the relative functional unity of the basic contexts of PoS use. Both Panini and the authors of "Port-Royal" were already aware of such basic functions of lexical units as predicate and term.

In (Testelets 1990), the following syntactic functions are distinguished: position of the head predicate, position of the argument, function of non-possessive modifier to the argument, function of modifier to the predicate (or modifier to the argument), possessive modifier. Supplementing the inventory of functions with the possessive one helps to distinguish adjectives from nouns. The identification of a separate adverbial use (modifier to the predicate) allows distinguishing adverbs and adjectives – in those languages and in those cases where there are formal reasons for this, of course.

If we adopt such an inventory of functions, the PoS of Russian will be defined as follows, see also (Ibid.: 80). Verbs (`khodit'` 'to walk', `chitat'` 'to read') function as predicates, and require marking in other functions. In the function of an argument, they are marked by nominalization or agent nominalization markers, etc. (`khozhdenie` 'walking' / `chitatel'` 'reader'). In the function of a modifier, verbs receive participial markers (`khodyashchiy` 'walking', `prochitannyy` 'read'). In the function of an adverbial, verbs must receive a gerund marker (`khodya` 'walking', `prochitav` 'having read'). Verbs can perform the function of a possessor by becoming a verbal noun (or agent noun, etc.), and then receiving a genitive case marker (`khozhdeniya` 'of walking', `chitatelya` 'of the reader').

Nouns (`student` 'student', `dom` 'house') are arguments, but can function as predicates with the participation of a nominal copula and, optionally, instrumental marking (`byt' studentom` 'to be a student', `domom` 'as a house'). To become a modifier, a noun must receive derivational markers (`studencheskiy` 'student-ADJ', `domashniy` 'home-ADJ'). To perform the role of an adverbial, additional morphological marking with adverbial markers is necessary (`po-studencheski` 'in a student-like way', `po-domashnemu` 'in a home-like way'). Possessive relation is possible only with genitive marking.

Adjectives (`vysokiy` 'tall', `krasivyy` 'beautiful') are modifiers, can become predicates with the help of a nominal copula and optional instrumental marking (`byt' vysokim` 'to be tall', `krasivym` 'beautiful'). Adjectives become arguments through substantivization – an unmarked transition from modifiers to arguments (`Mne nravitsya vysokiy` 'I like the tall one'). To perform the function of an adverbial, additional morphological marking is required (`vysoko` 'highly', `krasivo` 'beautifully').

Finally, adverbs (`segodnya` 'today') are adverbials, but, by receiving morphological markers, can become modifiers to nouns (`segodnyashniy` 'today's'). Cases of use as a predicate or argument are difficult for semantic reasons, but permissible. Predicative use requires a copula (`Takoy den' byl segodnya` 'Such a day was today'). In the case of an argument function, conversion occurs – an unmarked transition to the function of another PoS (`Kazhdoe segodnya my dumaem o svoem vchera` 'Every today we think about our yesterday').

By applying such a methodology, the main PoS of a given language can be obtained. Of course, there will remain semantically non-empty lexemes possessing distributional properties that distinguish them from the main PoS of that language. Examples from Russian include all those words of the category of state (`zhal'` 'pity', `nedosug` 'no time'). But the vast majority of lexemes, nevertheless, will receive a categorical attribution.

So, we can speak of three or four basic PoS (the question of including or not including adverbs is up to each researcher). Let's return to the problem of universality. Cases where the adjective is not distinguished as a separate category, as is the case in Russian or English, indeed exist; they will be described below. But are there languages where there is no distinction between the two main classes, nouns and verbs? Logically, this is permissible in one of two cases: i) in languages where there is no morphological marking, any lexeme can perform any function in its original form; ii) in languages with rich morphology, any stem, when performing a certain function, can receive any morphological markers, regardless of its semantics. Let's examine these two examples in more detail.

### 1.1.3.2. PoS in Hawaiian: Unmarked Non-Distinction

As an example of languages where any word can unmarkedly perform any syntactic function, Old Chinese is usually cited. Let's consider, however, an example from Hawaiian (Austronesian, Polynesian):

(10) Hawaiian
(Belikov 1990: 181)
- a. ka hua 'ai
    DEF.SG fruit edible
    'edible fruit'
- b. ka 'ai maika'i
    DEF.SG food good
    'good food'
- c. ua 'ai nui 'oia
    PERF eat much he
    'he ate a lot'
- d. ua nui na 'ai
    PERF much DEF.PL food
    'there was a lot of food'
- e. ka hale nui
    DEF.SG house big
    'big house'
- f. ka nui o ka hale
    DEF.SG greatness POSS DEF.SG house
    'the size of the house'

In this example, the stem `'ai` appears in the following functions: modifier ('edible'), argument ('food'), predicate ('to eat'). The stem `nui` is an adverb or quantifier ('much'), an adjective ('big'), a noun ('greatness'). In all these uses, the same lexemes perform various functions without additional marking.

In reality, according to (Belikov 1990; Testelets 1990: 83), Hawaiian distinguishes nouns and verbs, however, this example demonstrates a possible strategy for the absence of such a distinction.

The tendency towards non-distinction between nouns and verbs (and PoS in general) is regularly demonstrated by so-called polysynthetic languages; in English-language literature, examples from Salish or Wakashan languages are usually given.

### 1.1.3.3. PoS in Adyghe: Marked Non-Distinction

Let's consider an example from Adyghe (Abkhaz-Adyghe). Units denoting physical objects (presumed nouns) and units denoting actions (presumed verbs) can perform both predicate and argument functions:

(11) Adyghe
(Testelets 2009: 31-13)
- a. Kʼale qɛ-kʼu-agh.
    boy DIR-go-PST
    'The boy came.'
- b. My bzylyfyghe-r sə s-i-şzazy-gh.
    this woman-ABS I 1.SG-POSS-wife-PST
    'This woman was my wife.'
- c. Sə-ry-scht tekh-osh_ty-r.
    I-PRED-FUT win-FUT-ABS
    'Apparently, I will be the one to win.' (lit.: 'Apparently, it is I who will be the one who wins.')

In example (a), the noun is used as an argument (unmarked by case), and the verb as a predicate. In (b), the noun (`şzazy` 'wife') becomes a predicate, taking tense and agreement markers. In (c), a lexeme with the meaning of an action (`tekh` 'to win') becomes an argument, acquiring the absolutive case marker.

At first glance, any lexeme appears capable of performing any function. However, as the authors of the collection (Testelets 2009: 31-13) point out, this is not the case. Verbs are distinguished from nouns and adjectives by their inability to attach possessive affixes:

(12) Adyghe
(Testelets 2009: 32)
- a. s-i-pyy
    1.SG-POSS-enemy
    'my enemy'
- b. s-i-psynkʼe
    1.SG-POSS-fast
    'my fast one'
- c. *s-i-kʼa-ghə
    1.SG-POSS-go-PST
    Expected: 'my gone one'

Another important distinction between nouns and verbs is as follows. In Abkhaz-Adyghe languages, there is a "hidden category" of definiteness, expressed through differentiated case marking. In the example below, a case-marked noun phrase implies a definite reading, and an unmarked one an indefinite reading:

(13) Adyghe
(Testelets 2009: 34)
My 'əryse(-r) qy-s-ə-t.
apple(-ABS) DIR-1.SG.IO-OBL-give
'Give me (this) apple.'

However, when a verb is used as an argument, there is no such possibility – verbal stems must always be case-marked:

(14) Adyghe
(Testelets 2009: 34)
Qə-p-şəfy-ghə-r / *qəpşəfyghə qy-s-ə-t.
DIR-2.AG-buy-PST-ABS / DIR-2.AG-buy-PST DIR-1.SG.IO-OBL-give
'Give me what you bought.'

As we can see, a careful analysis of distributional properties still provides grounds for distinguishing the main PoS.

* * *
It can be concluded that the hypothesis of the existence of "languages without parts of speech" is too strong – in reality, (grammatical) grounds for distinguishing nouns and verbs can most likely be found in all languages.

## 1.1.4. Principles of PoS Identification: Summary

We have discussed the history of study and the principles of PoS identification, as well as the question of PoS universality across world languages, which is central to adjectives. The question of universality consists of the following parts: i) how universal is the set of (lexical) PoS in world languages; ii) how universal is the distribution of lexemes across specific (lexical) PoS in world languages, i.e., to what extent do PoS boundaries coincide in different languages; iii) are PoS that are not among the universal PoS permissible in a given language? The answers to these questions are likely as follows: i) the opposition between nouns and verbs is universal, but regarding other lexical PoS, primarily adjectives, there is no complete consensus; ii) the boundaries of various PoS do not necessarily coincide in all languages (where a given PoS exists); iii) different languages may present distributional classes of lexemes with specific properties which, however, we will not consider as parts of speech.

In the following exposition, we will adhere to a procedural approach to PoS, based on markedness theory. A PoS K of a given language is a derivationally unmarked distributional class with a set of grammatical categories specific to it in that language. The distributional properties of a class are determined by a basic set of universal syntactic functions: argument, predicate, and modifier. Typologically defined GCs are "assigned" to specific parts of speech.

## 1.2. Adjectives as a Part of Speech

## 1.2.1. Key Morphosyntactic Properties of Adjectives

Let's say a bit more about "universality." In a number of works, both typological and formal, adjectives are recognized with varying degrees of explicitness as a universal class, see, for example, (Croft 1991; Baker 2003; Dixon 2004; Cinque 2010) and others. How does this relate to the fact that some languages do not possess formal means by which adjectives could be distinguished as a separate class? Authors who speak of the universality of adjectives generally refer to the universal nature of semantic or functional properties, or of syntactic features underlying adjectives. From the perspective of such a "universalist approach," a language may, for example, not possess special categories characteristic (only) of adjectives, but still demonstrate some discrepancies between verbs / nouns and adjectives. Such discrepancies may concern syntactic distribution, compatibility with grammatical markers, or derivational morphology.

In the course of the discussion we will undertake in this work, we will arrive at a similar conclusion. We will also show that the adjective category can be considered universal, despite the fact that in some languages there may not be visible formal grounds for distinguishing adjectives as a separate PoS. In our case, however, the grounds for recognizing a universal nature will differ. For instance, in M. Baker's model (see Baker 2003), adjectives describe properties, and consequently have a typologically universal structure that does not allow for reference or semantic role assignment. For G. Cinque, the universality of adjectives is due to their characteristic so-called direct modification, i.e., the ability of lexemes with specific semantics to occupy certain positions in the functional structure of the noun phrase. In both mentioned cases – as well as in typologically-oriented approaches (Croft 1991; Dixon 2004) et al. – semantics plays a key role. Anticipating (by about 1 chapter), we will say that for us, the universality of the adjective category will actually follow from the universality of the functional head A (attribute, adjective, adjunct, …), which is responsible for attributive use. The formation of the adjective category, from our point of view, is the development of morphological means in a language, thanks to which a certain class of lexemes is identified with this functional head. Head A is universal, therefore the adjective category is also universal.

Let us turn to the discussion of GCs relevant to adjectives. Such categories include attributiveness and predicativity – the grammaticalized ability for a group of lexemes to be used in attributive and predicative functions, respectively. Besides these two categories, the category of comparison (comparative) is considered key for adjectives as a lexical-grammatical class. Developed means of intensification are semantically related to the comparative. All listed categories are crucial for adjectives. Below, we will briefly present each GC, and in Chapters 2 and 3, we will describe them in more detail.

In accordance with the typological approach to PoS, if a certain class of words can be used unmarked in the function of a noun modifier, such a class is the most probable candidate for adjectives, see (Croft 1991; Bhat 1994; Beck 2002; Dixon 2004) et al. The nature of such a syntactic position – modifier or attribute – is quite enigmatic. Since the Port-Royal era, it has been evident that semantically, adjectives function as predicates just like verbs. At the same time, the adjective is characterized by the position of a modifier within the noun phrase, yet the nature of this position is viewed differently by everyone. In this book, we will try to show that the modifier position can be considered syntactically primitive and irreducible to predicative use; see also (Cinque 2010) and other works by G. Cinque here.

Let us turn to the discussion of attributiveness as a criterion for distinguishing adjectives. If a language has a class of lexemes for which the function of attribute is unmarked, such lexemes will be the primary candidates for adjectives. In English or Russian, adjectives – unlike verbs or nouns – act as attributes without additional marking:

(15) English
the fast boat
Bystraya lodka
'the fast boat'

(16) English
the floating boat
Plyvushchaya lodka
'the floating boat'

(17) English
the wooden boat
Derevyannaya lodka
'the wooden boat'

Based on their ability for attributive use, all stems can be divided into those that do not require additional marking (`fast`, `bystr-`), and those that must be marked (`float-`, `plyv-`; `wood`, `derev-`).

There is, however, a strategy radically opposite to Russian or English. It consists in that any nominal dependents receive identical marking. Thus, according to (Kibrik 1999), the Tsakhur language has an attributive category. The attributive effectively serves as a means of marking any member of a noun phrase; examples are given below for referential and non-referential possessors, predicate stems (= adjectives), and relative clauses:

(18) Tsakhur (Kibrik 1999: 378)
a. adam ī-na dost
   man-ATTR friend
   'husband's friend'
b. wɨRɨle-na guǯ
   man-ATTR strength.3
   'man's strength'

(19) Tsakhur (Kibrik 1999: 99)
Abna jug-na balkan.
go.PST good-ATTR horse
'A good horse came.'

(20) Tsakhur (Kibrik 1999: 87)
Zak'le Gajǯena [ gade horRul ]-na jedj.
I saw [boy washed]-ATTR mother
'I saw the mother who washed the boy.'

The attributive, therefore, marks the dependency of an element of any category, including an entire constituent, on the head noun. In this book, we will consistently develop the idea of the existence of an attributive. From our point of view, every language has a functional head A, responsible for the attributive use of units such as adjectives, participles, and some others.

A similar situation occurs in Chinese. Chinese possesses the noun-dependent marker `de`, also glossed below as an attributive. This marker has broad compatibility and can mark a possessor, an adjective, a relative clause, or a postpositional phrase:

(21) Chinese
xiao-hai de mama
child ATTR mother
'child's mother'

(22) Chinese
piao-liang de nü-ren
beautiful ATTR woman
'beautiful woman'

(23) Chinese
[ hua zai qiang shang ] de hua
draw IPF wall on ATTR drawing
'drawing drawn on the wall'

(24) Chinese
[ shan shang ] de wu-zi
mountain on ATTR house
'house on the mountain'

Let's return to the Tsakhur language. In (Kibrik 1999), lexemes corresponding to Russian adjectives are called predicatives. They received this label because, in their least marked form, they function as predicates in Tsakhur: "Semantically, they [predicatives. P. G.] are predicates (they have at least one valency with the meaning of the bearer of a given property or a participant remaining in a given state). By this property, they are similar to verbs. On the other hand, for these words, the typical (statistically predominant, i.e., unmarked) syntactic position is not the predicate position (basic for verbs), but the noun modifier position" (Kibrik 1999: 92). Let's give an example of the use of a predicative in the function of a predicate:

(25) Tsakhur (Kibrik 1999: 854)
Xiw mɨs-mɨk'a qi-w-xa.
village.3 hungry-cold 3-become
'It became cold and hungry in the village. [= The village became hungry-cold.]'

(26) Tsakhur (Kibrik 1999: 96)
Gade našwalin č'ara qixa.
boy from.shame red became
'The boy turned red from shame.'

In fact, Tsakhur adjectives are predicatives with an attributive marker. We will try to show in subsequent chapters that such an analysis, proposed by A. E. Kibrik, is applicable not only to Tsakhur.

Tsakhur, one way or another, resorts to the use of various auxiliary verbs for adjectives in predicative position. In Chapter 3, we will analyze the situation in Ossetian, which strongly resembles Tsakhur. The difference from Tsakhur, perhaps, is that Ossetian draws a clear line between nominal predication and other predicative uses of adjectives (so-called complex predicates).

The strategy for forming nominal predication with adjectives in Romance, Germanic, Slavic, and other languages also involves marking the predicative function. In the following cases, the use of a nominal copula is critically necessary:

(27) French
La maison est vieille.
DEF house COP old
'The house is old.'

(28) English
The house is old.

(29) Bulgarian
Kŭshtata e stara.
house COP old.F
'The house is old.'

So-called languages with statives are structured differently – languages where values familiar to us are actually conveyed by intransitive verbs. In Vietnamese, an adjective can, like a verb, head an independent clause:

(30) Vietnamese (Dam 2006: 187)
Giáo sư Smith thông minh vô cùng.
Professor Smith smart without limits
'Professor Smith is very smart.'

In languages that possess means for encoding aspect and tense, such "adjectives" receive relevant aspect-tense markers. In the following examples from Qiang (Sino-Tibetan), statives can be marked with continuative and prospective, as well as iterative and inchoative:

(31) Qiang (LaPolla, Huang 2004: 310)
a. Mə tɕaχ qa:.
   sky CONTIN-clean:PROSP
   'The sky will still be clean.'
b. Mutuple: zə-məpa-j-ji.
   weather PREF-cold-IT-INCH
   'It's getting cold again.'

Let us say a few words about another important facet for adjectives – their use as secondary predicates. In some languages, cf. the Edo example below, adjectives (but not verbs) can be used as secondary resultative predicates:

(32) Edo (Baker 2003: 219)
Òzó kòkó Àdésuwa mòsèmòsè.
Ozo raise Adesuwa beautiful
'Ozo raised Adesuwa beautiful.'

We will discuss the specifics of adjective use in predicative function (compared to attributive) in more detail in Chapter 2. We will also thoroughly investigate another property linking adjectives with (verbal) predicates – the ability to introduce various types of participants into the syntactic structure. Chapter 3 will be devoted to this.

The comparative (and partially the superlative) is the most characteristic category for adjectives, see (Bhat 1994; Dixon, Aikhenvald 2004). For example, in the Dravidian language Kannada, which has an independent category of adjectives, the comparative construction is formed by attaching a dative marker to the object of comparison:

(33) Kannada (Bhat 1994: 26)
Idu adakk-inta doḍḍa mane.
this that(DAT)-CMP big house
'This house is bigger than that one.'

An attempt to form an analogous construction based on nouns or verbs leads to ungrammaticality:

(34) Kannada (Bhat 1994: 26)
* Allig-inta jana illi se:ridda:re.
  there(DAT)-CMP people here gather
  '*More people here than there.'

(35) Kannada (Bhat 1994: 26)
* Avanu nanag-inta o:d-idda:ne.
  he I(DAT)-CMP read
  '*He read more than I did.'

However, there are typologically attested cases where the comparative and superlative are formed from nouns and/or verbs. In Sanskrit, nominal forms can receive comparative and superlative markers:

(36) Sanskrit (Bhat 1994: 182)
Govinda:d ra:mo vidvat-taraḥ.
Govinda(ABL) Rama(NOM) expert-CMP
'Rama is wiser than Govinda.'

(37) Sanskrit (Bhat 1994: 182)
Ra:maḥ sarveṣu suhṛt-tamaḥ.
Rama(NOM) all(LOC) friend-SUP(NOM)
'Rama is the best friend of all.'

In Wolof, adjectives and verbs form the comparative degree using the same marker `gena` (the verb 'to surpass'):

(38) Wolof (Mc Laughlin 2004: 258)
Ibu moo gëna nay Aamadu.
Ibu 3.SG CMP unhappy Amadu
'Ibu is unhappier than Amadu.'

(39) Wolof (Mc Laughlin 2004: 258)
Maa la gëna ligéey.
1.SG 2.PL CMP work
'I work more than you.'

The gradable nature of adjectives can manifest in the fact that for some adjectives, whose meanings correspond to the adjectival semantic zone, there exist non-derived comparative stems (Hajek 2004):

(40) Wolof (Hajek 2004: 258)
Aamadu moo sut Ibu.
Amadu 3.SG taller Ibu
'Amadu is taller than Ibu.'

Even in languages where the adjective coincides in its basic distributional properties with a noun or a verb, the comparative can provide grounds for distinguishing verbs, nouns, and adjectives. Thus, in Tagalog, "[i]f no accentuation change occurs, there is a complete formal identity of verbs and adjectives, adjectives and nouns, blurring semantic boundaries between PoS, for example, `madali` 'fast', `madali` 'to be fast', 'to hurry'…" (Shkarban 1995: 166).

The comparative in Tagalog is formed from adjectives as well as other PoS. However, the rules for using the comparative with adjectives and verbs differ. Thus, P. Schachter indicates that the comparative adverb `mas` 'more' is obligatory for constructions with verbs and optional with adjectives:

(41) Tagalog (Schachter, Otanes 1972: 240)
( Mas ) mabigat ang aso kaysa-sa pusa.
(CMP) heavy PRT dog than cat
'The dog is heavier than the cat.'

(42) Tagalog (Schachter, Otanes 1972: 241)
* ( Mas ) pinaniniwalaan ko si Juan kaysa-sa-kay Pedro.
  (CMP) believe I PRT Juan than Pedro
  '*I believe Juan more than Pedro.'

Another difference is found in the interpretation of reduplicated forms, see, for example, (Hajek 2004). Stem repetition regularly corresponds to a meaning of greater intensity, cf. Russian `dlinnyy` 'long' - `(pre)dlinnyy` 'very long'; Bagvalal `L'anu` 'thick' vs. `L'ani-L'anu` 'very thick', etc. In some cases, as in Vietnamese, reduplication is, on the contrary, associated with deintensification (Van Ko 2015: 92-93).

Tagalog adjectives, despite the apparent absence of formal distinctions from nouns and verbs, also inherit this typologically stable tendency for adjectives towards reduplication. As L. I. Shkarban notes, "[t]he superlative (comparative) degree in adjectives is also expressed by the `kaR-an` model (R - two-syllable doubling), for example, … `kamura-murahan` … The structural feature (doubling) distinguishes this adjectival model from verbal and substantive models with `ka-an` (for process verbs - passive voice, for nouns - a means of forming abstract nouns)" (Shkarban 1995: 1968).

In Thai, where adjectives (primarily) are a verbal subclass, comparative constructions also allow adjectival statives, but not stative or active verbs:

(43) Thai (Post 2008: 345)
a. Khon nii suung kwaa khon nan.
   person this tall CMP person that
   'This person is taller than that one.'
b. * Khon nii khit / dəən kwaa khon nan.
   person this think / walk CMP person that
   Expected: '*This person thinks / walks more than that one.'

Thus, formal means of expressing comparison and intensification allow distinguishing adjectives from units of other lexical classes in world languages.

Finally, there is another co-occurrence feature that regularly distinguishes adjectives from other PoS – the choice of derivational markers. In Thai, lexemes with semantics characteristic of adjectives possess syntactic and morphological properties of verbs. However, there are the following differences. In the case of nominalizer selection, verbal and adjective-stative lexemes resort to different strategies. Verbs are marked with the marker `khwaam`, while adjectives are marked with the marker `kaan`:

(44) Thai
a. khwaam dii
   NMN good
   'goodness'
b. *kaan dii
   NMN good

(45) Thai (Post 2008: 349)
a. *khwaam dəən
   NMN walk
b. kaan dəən
   NMN walk
   'walking'

A similar situation occurs with the marker `jàaŋ`, which produces adverbs. It combines with adjectives, but not with verbs:

(46) Thai (Post 2008: 355)
a. Phûut kàp phûujàj jàaŋ-suphâap.
   speak COM elder ADV-polite
   'Speak politely with elders.'
b. * Phûut kàp phûujàj jàaŋ-rúu.
   speak COM elder ADV-know
   Expected: '*Speak knowledgeably with elders.'

* * *

So, in this section, we have described the following contexts important for adjectives: attributive use, predicative use (including secondary-predicative use), and the ability to form degrees of comparison and intensification forms. Next, we will describe in more detail the features of adjective use in these contexts. We will also pay attention to the type of derivational morphology used – this can also be an important criterion for distinguishing adjectives as a separate PoS.

## 1.2.2. Adjective Suffixes as Elements Determining Their Distribution (Based on Russian Data)

## 1.2.2.1. Syntactic Derivation and Derivational Morphology

When combining individual units of syntactic structure, it is always necessary to select an element of a specific class: combining adjectives with nouns to form noun phrases, adverbs with verbs to form verb phrases, etc. The belonging of a certain element to a particular class plays a key role in syntactic derivation.

Among Russian adjective lexemes, there is a certain number of non-derived ones: `bol'shoy` 'big', `malyy` 'small', `plokhoy` 'bad', `khoroshiy` 'good', etc. Alongside non-derived adjectives, Russian has a large number that are formed from nouns, verbs, and other parts of speech. Russian marks the transition of lexical units from the class of nouns and verbs into the adjective class using special markers. In the absence of such markers, the formation of the full form of the adjective is impossible, cf.:

(47) Russian
a. trud-n-yy, god-n-yy
   labor-N-ADJ, fit-N-ADJ
   'laborious, suitable'
b. *trud-yy, *god-yy

An incomplete list of productive adjective suffixes is as follows (for the first two, many variants or morphs are also recognized): `-n`, `-sk`, as well as: `-an`, `-ann`, `-abel'n`, `-iro-vann`, `-ov`, `-iansk`, `-ast`, `-am`, `-chat`, `-ovat`, `-ovit`, `-ist`, `-liv`, `-av` (adjective formation from nouns); `-l'n`, `-tel'n`, `-abel'n`, `-ov`, `-sk`, `-k`, `-om-/-im`, `-ist`, `-chat`, `-uch-/-ach`, `-liv-/-chiv`, `-l`, `-yon-/-n`, `-t`, `-yonn-/-nn` (adjective formation from verbs), see (AG-80-1: §§ 610-682).

There are the following logical possibilities for marking the transition from one lexical class to another: i) the transition from one class to another is always marked, ii) the transition is never marked, iii) recategorization can be marked or unmarked. Let us briefly elaborate on each option.

Approach i) is adopted, for example, in Distributed Morphology (Marantz 1997). According to this analysis, all roots are acategorial. An adjectival (or any other) stem is marked with a categorial marker, null or phonologically expressed, in the process of derivation. A possible rule for generating a noun phrase with an adjective would look like this (Adj - head assigning the adjectival category):

(48) NP → [AdjP [√] Adj] + N

Approach ii) is proposed in (Borer 2014a; 2014b). In this case, the stem may not be marked with a feature related to the adjective; for successful syntactic derivation, it is sufficient that it is not marked with another part-of-speech feature. An algorithm corresponding to such an approach can be represented as:

(49) NP → [xP [√] x] + N | x ≠ N, V , Adv, …

In the case of adjectives, x = Adj or is undefined, and then the projection of the "adjective shell" AdjP is absent.

Approach iii) is presented in traditional grammars or functional-typological literature. For example, in (Croft 1991), for each of the main lexical classes, the existence of prototypical category elements is proposed, whose use in the corresponding function (adjective in our case) is unmarked. Elements of other classes can transition into this category, but in doing so, they must receive appropriate markers. In this approach, (nominal and verbal) stems use special recategorizing markers to transition into the adjective class, while the root of lexemes like `bol'shoy` 'big', `malyy` 'small', `plokhoy` 'bad', `khoroshiy` 'good' is already represented in the dictionary as belonging to the adjective category and does not require additional marking.

All approaches have their weaknesses and strengths. Analysis i) is unsuccessful, for example, in that it assumes the existence of homonymous null (re)categorizers, as pointed out in (Borer 2014a; 2014b). Indeed, besides non-derived adjectives, there are also non-derived units of other parts of speech – for all these cases, null category-change markers must exist. This devalues the idea of null units.

Analysis ii) loses to approach i) in that it presupposes some complication of derivation rules. Instead of (48), rule (49) is needed, imposing additional restrictions that at first glance do not follow from the wordform structure. Analysis iii) presupposes the existence of two (comparable in power) sources of adjective units: "adjectives by birth" and "adjectives by conversion". Thus, iii) loses in generality compared to i) and ii). As we will, however, see, solution iii) most adequately describes linguistic facts, particularly for Russian. Many stems demonstrate a certain categorical affiliation from the very beginning of derivation.

A possible way to explain why derived and non-derived adjectives possess similar properties is to attribute responsibility for these properties to a single categorical feature. In some stems, this feature is already present in the lexicon, while others acquire it during derivation. The source of the distributional properties itself is identical. In the case of Russian adjectives, it corresponds to one of two large categories: Adj (derived and non-derived adjectives) and Atr (derived attributives).

All three approaches, one way or another, refer to the idea of recategorizing markers. In this section, we will examine the properties of Russian adjectives formed using the suffixes listed above. The main focus will be on the properties of the suffixes `-n` and `-sk`, as they are the most regular and productive.

Let's note another extremely important problem. In studies dedicated to adjectives (as well as other parts of speech), the question of how adjectivizing markers (and other derivational markers) "know" about the category of the root to which they attach is rarely raised; see the discussion in (Lieber 2006). With the exception of the mentioned work, almost all known sources overlook this question.

Since the appearance of (Chomsky 1970), the acategoriality of root morphemes constituting the lexicon has become almost universally accepted, cf. works in terms of Distributed Morphology, Hagit Borer's approach to morphology, etc. Upon entering syntactic derivation, such an acategorial root is supplied with a part-of-speech marker, combining with null recategorizers [n], [v], etc.:

(50) a. [ n [√ refuse ]] → the quantity of [ DP refuses ] to be collected
b. [ v [√ refuse ]] → He [ vP refuses to abandon their baby ].

However, some suffixes marking the transition to another part of speech themselves impose co-occurrence restrictions on the type of root to which they will be attached. The problem of adjectivizing suffixes selecting roots of the "right" category can be illustrated with the following Russian material:

(51) Russian
a. -itel'n: utesh- + -itel'n → uteshitel'nyy
   comfort.VERB.STEM + -itel'n → comforting
   *plech- + -itel'n
   *shoulder.NOUN.STEM + -itel'n

If derivational morphology is necessary to supply wordforms with the correct categorial features, how can derivational markers choose which categorial types of stems they can attach to? The assumption of the existence of null (re)categorizers in the examples above does not significantly improve the situation: why categorize acategorial roots if immediately after that they need to be recategorized:

(52) a. -itel'n: [ Adj [ v [√ utesh ]  v ] itel'n ]
b. -ist: [ Adj [ n [√ plech ]  n ] ist ]

The very idea of categorically unspecified roots, necessarily attaching recategorizing heads, is (partly) based on considerations of economy. Indeed, having two `refuse` stems, nominal and verbal, in the lexicon is redundant. One could have a single acategorial root and rules for transforming it into a stem of any category. With such an approach, in cases like Russian `*plech + itel'n`, `*utesh + ist`, the idea of the universality of derivation "acategorial root - categorizing affix" turns out to be discredited. Derivational morphemes (`-itel'n`, `-ist`, …): i) themselves assign a certain categorial type so that syntax can operate with this element, and ii) impose their own restrictions on the non-derived stems to which they attach. The fact of the existence of various derivational morphemes with different co-occurrence properties thus strongly discredits the idea of acategorial roots and null (re)categorizers.

## 1.2.2.2. Functions of Russian Suffixes -n and -sk According to AG-80

The Academic Grammar-80 defines the cases of adjective formation with the suffix `-n` from nouns as follows: "Adjectives with a suffix represented by the morph `-n₁` …, denote a feature related to an object or phenomenon named by the motivating word: `khlebnyy` 'bread-ADJ', `vodnyy` 'water-ADJ', `lesnoy` 'forest-ADJ', `morkovnyy` 'carrot-ADJ', `teplichnyy` 'greenhouse-ADJ', `inzhenernyy` 'engineer-ADJ', `vedomstvennyy` 'departmental', `tuberkuleznyy` 'tuberculosis-ADJ', `stoimostnyy` 'cost-ADJ', `glubinnyy` 'depth-ADJ', `radostnyy` 'joy-ADJ', `massazhnyy` 'massage-ADJ', `translyatsionnyy` 'broadcast-ADJ'" (AG-80-1: § 617). For cases of adjective formation using `-n` from verbs, the following definition is given: "Adjectives with a suffix represented by the morph `-n₁` - …, have the meaning 'characterized by a relation to the action named by the motivating word'", examples given include `bol'noy` 'sick', `sklonnyy` 'inclined', `slyshnyy` 'audible', `vidnyy` 'visible', `reznoy` 'carved', `lepnoy` 'sculpted', etc., see (AG-80-1: § 646).

The suffix `-sk` also participates in the formation of adjectives from both nouns and verbs. For the denominal function, we find: "Adjectives with a suffix represented by the morphs `-sk-` … `-esk-`, `-ichesk-`, `-ovsk-` and a number of other morphs ending in `-sk-` …, have the general meaning 'relating to or characteristic of what is named by the motivating word': `ottsovskiy` 'fatherly', `prepodavatel'skiy` 'teacher's', `plotnitskiy` 'carpenter's', `morskoy` 'marine', `universitetskiy` 'university', `kreyserskiy` 'cruiser's', `arifmeticheskiy` 'arithmetical'" (AG-80-1: § 630). The definition of `-sk` as a deverbal recategorizer is as follows: "Adjectives with the suffix `-sk-`/`-esk-`/`-tel'sk-` have the meaning 'relating to the action of the person named by the motivating word': `koldovat'` 'to cast spells' - `koldovskoy` 'sorcerous', `izdevasya` 'to mock' - `izdevaatel'skiy` 'mocking' … `brodyazhnicheskiy` 'vagabond-like', `zhul'nicheskiy` 'swindler-like' … `izmyvatel'skiy` 'taunting', `naduvatel'skiy` 'deceptive' …" (AG-80-1: § 630).

As can be seen, the semantic description for both `-n` and `-sk` operates with the same terms: "relating to," "characterized by relation to," etc. However, it seems to us that the main differences in the properties of `-n` and `-sk` are not semantic in nature.

Let's begin the comparison of these suffixes with another quote from AG-80: "The peculiarity of the productive morph `-ichn` lies in the fact that all words with this morph... are derivational synonyms of adjectives with the morph `-ichesk-` …: `simvolicheskiy` 'symbolic' - `simvolichnyy` 'symbolic', `demokraticheskiy` 'democratic' - `demokratichnyy` 'democratic'. Unlike words ending in `-icheskiy`, they are not only capable of expressing qualitative meanings but also possess morphological means for such expression: the possibility of forming short forms, comparatives, and abstract nouns" (AG-80-1: § 619). The facts listed here allow us to raise the following questions.

Firstly, it is not entirely clear why borrowed stems that belong to the adjective class in the source language require additional marking in Russian: `categoric + -n / -sk` → `kategorichnyy / kategoricheskiy`, `democratic + -n / -sk` → `demokratichnyy / demokraticheskiy`. Let's give examples of other borrowed adjective stems also requiring marking with Russian adjective suffixes: `-al`: `normal + -n` → `normal'nyy`; `neutral + -n` → `neytral'nyy`; `-ois`: `courtoise + n` → `kurtuaznyy`; `bourgeois + n` → `burzhuaznyy`, etc.

Secondly: what explains the differences in the properties of derivations with `-n` and `-sk`? The most important question seems to be whether they are dictated (only) by semantic considerations or have a syntactic nature.

Below, we will discuss the properties that distinguish derivatives with `-n` and `-sk`, using adjectives of the following types:

(53) Russian
a. chelovechnyy, predstavitel'nyy, spetsifichnyy, idiotichnyy, romantichnyy, dramatichnyy, fantastichnyy, …
b. chelovecheskiy, predstavitel'skiy, spetsificheskiy, idioticheskiy, romanticheskiy, dramaticheskiy, fantasticheskiy, …

## 1.2.2.3. Properties of Suffixes -n and -sk

Recategorization and Adverbial Function. The formation of units with adverbial functions seems the most ambiguous. On the one hand, adjectives marked with the suffix `-n` can easily be used in an adverbial function, while derivatives with `-sk` are less acceptable in this function:

(54) Russian
a. chelovechno, predstavitel'no, spetsifichno, idiotichno, romantichno, dramatichno, ??fantastichno, …
b. *chelovecheski, *predstavitel'ski, *spetsificheski, *idioticheski, */??romanticheski, ??dramaticheski, *fantastichheski, …

Let us give some examples: (55) presents sentences found online, and (56) presents their counterparts with `-sk`:

(55) Russian (internet)
a. Prezident Yanukovich vyglyadit bolee idiotichno, chem Yushchenko.
   President Yanukovych looks more idiotic, than Yushchenko.
   'President Yanukovych looks more idiotic than Yushchenko.'
b. Donal'd Tramp postupil vpolne chelovechno, privedya mal'chika na inaugaratsiyu…
   Donald Trump acted quite humanely, bringing boy to inauguration…
   'Donald Trump acted quite humanely by bringing the boy to the inauguration…'

(56) Russian
a. * Prezident Yanukovich vyglyadit bolee idioticheski, chem Yushchenko.
   * President Yanukovych looks more idiotically, than Yushchenko.
   '*President Yanukovych looks more idiotically than Yushchenko.'
b. * Donal'd Tramp postupil chelovecheski, privedya mal'chika na inaugaratsiyu…
   * Donald Trump acted humanly, bringing boy to inauguration…
   '*Donald Trump acted humanly by bringing the boy to the inauguration…'

It should be noted that formations with `-sk` are not absolutely ungrammatical. They regularly occur in the function of an adjective phrase modifier:

(57) Russian (internet)
a. Eti dva khokkeista fantasticheski khoroshi…
   These two hockey.players fantastically good…
   'These two hockey players are fantastically good…'
b. A glotatel' zhemchuga – chto-to syurrealisticheski srednee mezhdu iskazatelem zhemchuga i glotatelem shpag.
   And swallower of.pearls – something surrealistically average between seeker of.pearls and swallower of.swords.
   'And the pearl swallower is something surrealistically in between a pearl seeker and a sword swallower.'

- On the other hand, there are a number of formations with the suffix `-sk` that can be used in the function of a verb phrase modifier.
(58) Russian (Inscription on the memorial plaque of the Angleterre Hotel building)
Zdes' tragicheski oborvalas' zhizn' Sergeya Esenina.
Here tragically broke.off life of.Sergey Esenin.
'Here, Sergey Esenin's life tragically ended.'
(59) Russian (From S. D. Dovlatov's works)
Sistematicheski perevypolnyaet trudovye zadaniya…
Systematically overfulfills labor assignments…
'Systematically overfulfills labor assignments…'
(60) (internet)
Esli rassuzhdat' logicheski, pokupka umnykh chasov Apple Watch kazhetsya bessmyslennoy.
If reason logically, purchase smart watches Apple Watch seems meaningless.
'If one thinks logically, buying an Apple Watch seems meaningless.'
Sozhalenie o proshlom – bylo emu organicheski chuzhdo.
Regret about past – was him organically alien.
'Regret about the past was organically alien to him.'

These examples undoubtedly represent full adverbs. At the same time, for all the given adverbs ending in `-ski`, one can speak of the existence of a grammatical variant with the suffix `-n`:

(61) (internet)
a. Konchalos' eto obyknovenno tragichno: muzh vybrasyval uchitelya v okno.
   ended this usually tragically: husband threw.out teacher into window.
   'It usually ended tragically: the husband threw the teacher out the window.'
b. Amerikanskiy gosdepartament regulyarno i sistematichno vozit svoikh instruktorov v Yekaterinburg.
   American State.Department regularly and systematically brings its instructors to Yekaterinburg.
   'The US State Department regularly and systematically brings its instructors to Yekaterinburg.'
c. Chelovek, ne umeyushchiy rassuzhdat' logichno, vsegda upryam.
   person not knowing reason logically always stubborn
   'A person who cannot reason logically is always stubborn.'
d. Dom-kupol organichno vpisyvaetsya v lyuboy prirodnyy landshaft…
   house-dome organically fits into any natural landscape…
   'A dome-house organically blends into any natural landscape…'

Other adverbs ending in `-ski`, which have a `-n` correlate, can also be used as adverbs: `geroicheski` (heroically), `germeticheski` (hermetically), `gomericheski` (homerically), `grabitel'ski` (predatorily), `kategoricheski` (categorically), `komicheski` (comically), `kriticheski` (critically), `periodicheski` (periodically), `empiricheski` (empirically), `epizodicheski` (episodically), etc.

There are also adverbs ending in `-ski` for which the `-n` variant is difficult or impossible (for morphophonological or other reasons): `vsyacheski` (by all means), `vorovski` (thievishly), `zverski` (brutally), `zagovorshchicheski` (conspiratorially), `masterski` (masterfully), `molodetski` (bravely), `tvorcheski` (creatively), `yuridicheski` (legally), etc.

A correct generalization about the formation of adverbs from stems with suffixes `-n` and `-sk` could be: adverbs are regularly formed from adjectival stems with the suffix `-n` and sporadically from stems with `-sk`.

**Short form.** The short form is also available for formations with `-n` and unavailable for derivatives with `-sk`, see (Zaliznyak 2002: 90):

(62) Russian
a. chelovechen, predstavitel'en, spetsifichen, idiotichhen, romantichen, dramatichhen, fantastichhen, …
   humane.SHORT, presentable.SHORT, specific.SHORT, idiotic.SHORT, romantic.SHORT, dramatic.SHORT, fantastic.SHORT, …
b. *chelovechesk, *predstavitel'sk, *spetsifichesk, *idiotichesk, *romantichesk, *dramatichesk, *fantastichhesk, …

(63) (internet)
Muzhchina romantichen, tak kak odnoy iz ego zhiznennykh zadach yavlyaetsya zavoevanie zhenshchiny.
man romantic.SHORT as one of his life tasks is conquest of.woman
'A man is romantic, as one of his life's tasks is to conquer a woman.'

(64) Russian
* Muzhchina romantichesk, tak kak odnoy iz ego zhiznennykh zadach yavlyaetsya zavoevanie zhenshchiny.
  * man romantic.SHORT as one of his life tasks is conquest of.woman
  '*A man is romantic, as one of his life's tasks is to conquer a woman.'

**Comparative.** The comparative is structured similarly to adverbs and the short form:

(65) Russian
a. chelovechnee, predstavitel'nee, spetsifichnee, idiotichnee, romantichnee, dramatichnee, fantastichnee, …
   more.humane, more.presentable, more.specific, more.idiotic, more.romantic, more.dramatic, more.fantastic, …
b. *chelovecheskee, *predstavitel'skee, *spetsificheskee, *idioticheskee, *romanticheskee, *dramaticheskee, *fantasticheskee, …

(66) (internet)
Biznes v Rossii nemnogo spetsifichnee, chem na zapade ili v SShA, Azii.
business in Russia a.little more.specific than in west or in USA, Asia.
'Business in Russia is a little more specific than in the West or in the USA, Asia.'

(67) Russian
* Biznes v Rossii nemnogo spetsificheskee, chem na zapade ili v SShA, Azii.
  * business in Russia a.little more.specific than in west or in USA, Asia.
  '*Business in Russia is a little more specific than in the West or in the USA, Asia.'

Regarding the prohibition of morphological comparatives (MC), N. A. Yanko-Trinitskaya also notes: "Not all qualitative adjectives form synthetic forms of the comparative degree. These forms are not present in: 1) adjectives with the suffix `-sk-`: `druzheskiy` (friendly), `komicheskiy` (comical) (cf. `komichnyy` 'comical' - `komichnee` 'more comical'), `rebyacheskiy` (childish), `khanzheskiy` (hypocritical), `priyatel'skiy` (friendly), `tovarishcheskiy` (comradely), etc.; 2) many adjectives with the suffix `-l-`: `vpalyy` (sunken), `vyalyy` (listless), `doshlyy` (shrewd), `iskhudalyy` (emaciated), `bleklyy` (faded), `sipilyy` (hoarse), `khripilyy` (hoarse), etc.; 3) some adjectives with suffixes `-n-`, `-ov-`, `-k-`, for example: `ranniy` (early), `lishniy` (excess), `vneshniy` (external), `zlostnyy` (malicious), `prazdnyy` (idle), `bol'noy` (sick) (the form `bol'nee` only correlates with the adverb `bol'no`); `delovoy` (business-like), `boyevoy` (combat), `peredovoy` (leading), `ryadovoy` (ordinary), `massovyy` (mass); `gromozdkiy` (cumbersome), `derzkiy` (bold), `lipkiy` (sticky), `skol'zkiy` (slippery); 4) individual suffixless adjectives: `vetkhiy` (dilapidated), `nishchiy` (poor), `gordyy` (proud), `khmuriy` (gloomy)" (Yanko-Trinitskaya 1989: 68).

It is interesting that the reasons for which comparative forms with `-sk` are prohibited are not semantic. Indeed, the analytical comparative degree is formed from such units quite freely:

(68) (internet)
a. Rech' moderatorov priobrela bolee chelovecheskiy vid!
   speech moderators acquired more human-ADJ appearance!
   'The moderators' speech took on a more human appearance!'
b. Bolee predstavitel'skiy i universal'nyy GLklass i krossover GLA pomozhet ukrotit' dorozhnoe pokrytie odnim nazhatiem pedali.
   more presentable and universal GL-class and crossover GLA will.help tame road surface one press.by pedal.
   'The more presentable and versatile GL-Class and GLA crossover will help tame the road surface with a single pedal press.'
c. Luchshe upotrebit' bolee spetsificheskiy, chem menee spetsificheskiy termin.
   better to.use more specific-ADJ than less specific-ADJ term.
   'It is better to use a more specific rather than a less specific term.'
d. Eshche bolee idioticheskiy sluchay v Soyedinennykh Shtatakh Ameriki…
   even more idiotic-ADJ case in United States of.America…
   'An even more idiotic case in the United States of America…'

It can thus be assumed that the ungrammaticality of the combination of `-sk` with a comparative marker does not follow from semantics, but is related to the co-occurrence properties of the suffixes themselves. The same restrictions are relevant for some other derivational markers, cf.: `*zavidushchee` (cf. `zavidushchiy` 'envious'), `*ustarevshee` (cf. `ustarevshiy` 'outdated'), etc.

**Abstract nouns.** The formation of abstract nouns is generally subject to the same restrictions as the formation of adverbs, short forms, and comparatives:

(69) Russian
a. chelovechnost', predstavitel'nost', spetsifichnost', idiotichnost', romantichnost', dramatichnost', fantastichnost', …
   humanity, presentableness, specificity, idioticness, romanticness, dramaticness, fantasticness, …
b. *chelovecheskost', *predstavitel'skost', *spetsificheskost', *idioticheskost', *romanticheskost', *dramaticheskost', *fantasticheskost', …

  * despite on fantasticness, series of.images of.animals made with deep knowledge of.features and habits of.animals…
  '*Despite the fantasticalness, a number of animal images are made with deep knowledge of the animals' features and habits…'

From this regularity, however, a number of exceptions are observed:

(72) Russian
svetskost', detskost', zverskost', nebrokost', antisovetskost', …
secularity, childishness, brutality, unobtrusiveness, anti-sovietness, …

(73) (internet)
Dochka Mashka byla «romanticheskaya osoba» i vsyacheski etu samuyu «romanticheskost' natury» podcherkivala.
daughter Mashka was "romantic person" and by.all.means this very "romanticness of.nature" emphasized.
'Daughter Mashka was a "romantic person" and emphasized this "romanticness of nature" in every possible way.'

Despite the grammaticality of some abstract nouns derived from adjectives, it can be stated that for the suffix `-n`, the process of forming nominal derivatives with `-ost'` is absolutely productive, while for the suffix `-sk`, it is at least unproductive, and possibly limited.

**Compatibility with evaluative suffixes.** (AG-80-1) lists the following suffixes that attach to adjectives, modifying the degree of the property, adding the speaker's subjective evaluation, etc.: `-ovat`, `-on'k`, `-okhon'k`/`-oshen'k`, `-usen'k`, `-ushch`, `-enn`, `-eysh`/`-sh`, `-ist`, see §§ 666-673. Not all of them readily combine with every adjective ending in `-n`, but the most regular ones, `-on'k` and `-eysh`, form corresponding forms without visible difficulties. The combination of `-on'k`/`-eysh` with `-sk` is ungrammatical:

  '*And this most specific size, a size with such a "reputation," turns out to be quite equal in various modifications…'

**Restrictions on government.** The ability of adjectival units to govern lexically is also blocked when the suffix `-sk` is used:

(80) (internet)
a. Ved' bagazhnik etogo universala naibolee praktichnyy vo vsem semeystve Golf, dazhe po sravneniyu s venom Golf Plus.
   after.all trunk of.this station.wagon most practical in all family Golf, even by comparison with minivan Golf Plus.

   '*practical in everything'

a. Mir stol' real'nyy dlya neyo i stol' fantastichnyy dlya nas.
   world so real for her and so fantastic for us.
   'The world so real for her and so fantastic for us.'
b. *fantasticheskiy dlya nas
   *fantastic for us
   '*fantastic for us'

(82) (internet)
a. Pri lyubykh obstoyatel'stvakh nuzhno ostavat'sya chelovechnym k lyudyam.
   under any circumstances must remain humane to people.
   'Under any circumstances, one must remain humane to people.'
b. *chelovecheskiy k lyudyam
   *human to people
   '*human to people'

As we can see, the expression of valencies inherent in individual stems is blocked by suffixes like `-sk`.

## 1.2.2.4. Suffixes as Independent Units with Selective Properties

Let us summarize the results obtained. Nominal and verbal roots in Russian, when transitioning into the adjective class, are necessarily marked by special indicators, such as `-n`, `-sk`, and others. Use in the attributive function (= formation of the full form) without these suffixes is impossible. Borrowed adjectives must be formed with the same suffixes – they are also not used without recategorization markers.

The possibility of attributive use is not, however, connected with the suffixes themselves. This follows, for example, from the existence of a large subclass of non-derived adjectives. The (thematic) suffix `-oj` (Halle, Matushansky 2006) may be responsible for the ability to be used attributively; we will investigate this question in detail in Chapter 2.

Furthermore, the functions of various adjective suffixes turn out not to be identical. Thus, thanks to the suffix `-sk`, the original root acquires the possibility of only attributive use. At the same time, the suffix `-n` makes permissible the use of the newly formed unit in the function of an adverb, in short form, in the comparative, and also allows the formation of abstract nouns and new adjectives with evaluative suffixes.

The different distribution of syntactic functions among different suffixes, particularly the case of `-sk` vs. `-n` (with the latter, for example, suffixes like `-liv`, `-at`, and others are combined), also suggests that they do not have a common function – to convert lexemes into the adjective class. More precisely, the relationship between their functions can be defined as a partial overlap: both `-n` and `-sk` allow the formation of attributive adjective forms, but the similarity in their use ends there.

It seems that the following can be considered an important result, see also (Matushansky 2010):

(83) Observation on the selective properties of affixes
Affixes, when forming a new stem, impose restrictions on its subsequent compatibility with other affixes and its participation in particular syntactic contexts.

Let us ask what type of stems the investigated suffixes can attach to. As we have seen, `-n` and `-sk` (like other adjective suffixes) can form nominal (a) and verbal (b) stems:

(84) Russian (AG-80-1: §§ 610-682)
a. lesnoy (forest-ADJ), morkovnyy (carrot-ADJ), trudnyy (difficult), radostnyy (joyful), …; plotnitskiy (carpenter's), morskoy (marine), universitetskiy (university), konskiy (horse's), …
b. sklonnyy (inclined), pokornyy (submissive), slyshnyy (audible), skuchnyy (boring), …; koldovskoy (sorcerous), brodyazhnicheskiy (vagabond-like), zhul'nicheskiy (swindler-like), …

In addition, adjective suffixes can attach to borrowed stems which, from the perspective of the Russian grammatical system, do not possess any part-of-speech feature:

(85) Russian
normal'nyy (normal), neytral'nyy (neutral), kurtuaznyy (courteous), burzhuaznyy (bourgeois), kategoricheskiy (categorical), demokraticheskiy (democratic), …

However, there is another open class of units to which `-n` and `-sk` regularly attach – syntactic formations consisting of a noun and an adjective, a noun and a numeral, a noun and a quantifier, a noun and a preposition, etc.; regarding the latter type, see, for example, (Matushansky 2010):

(86) Russian
a. yuzhnoafrikanskiy (South African), vysokogornyy (high-mountain), legkoatleticheskiy (track-and-field)
b. dvukhkoesnyy (two-wheeled), trekh etazhnyy (three-story), pyatikomnatnyy (five-room)
c. vserossiyskiy (all-Russian), vsepogodnyy (all-weather), kazhdodnevnyy (daily)
d. pridorozhnyy (roadside), okolofutbol'nyy (football-related), zamorskiy (overseas), posleobedennyy (post-lunch)

It is evident that complex derivatives to which an adjective suffix attaches in this case also do not belong to one or another lexical class. We will discuss such cases in detail in Chapter 4.

## 1.2.2.5. Syntactic Properties of Adjective Suffixes in Russian: Results

Thus, using the examples of `-n` and `-sk`, we observed that Russian adjective suffixes implement the following functions:

(87) Properties of Russian adjective suffixes:
a. Suffixal markers of adjectival derivation form stems of various part-of-speech affiliations, as well as stems lacking features of any lexical category (borrowings, syntactic complexes);
b. Such markers provide the stems formed with their help the ability to form attributive forms (`-n`, `-sk`);
c. Suffixes are divided into two types depending on the distributional properties that the units formed with their help will possess;
d. Suffixes of the first type allow the stems formed with their help to form adverbs, short forms, comparatives, abstract nouns, and evaluative adjectives (`-n`);
e. Suffixes of the second type do not license all the contexts listed above (`-sk`);
f. Derivational suffixes have restrictions on compatibility with stems of a certain type – similar to how syntactic units can only attach certain types of projections (verbal, nominal, etc.), suffixes also impose restrictions on the part-of-speech category of the elements with which they combine.

At the same time, the role of the suffixes `-n` and `-sk` themselves differs: `-n` can be called a full adjectivizer – it converts the original stem into a new category with all functions available for that category. In contrast, `-sk` is only an attributivizer – it assigns the stem features necessary for use in the function of a modifier, without making the newly formed lexeme a full adjective. An important property of adjectival and attributive morphology is the selective ability of suffixes. The suffix built on at the next stage "knows" what type of stem from the previous derivation stage it can (or cannot) attach to.

## 1.2.3. Semantic Typology of Adjectivity

Let us briefly discuss some general aspects of adjective semantics, and then turn to the most important question for us – the problem of semantic classification of adjectives. Distinguishing the lexical zone of adjectives and drawing boundaries within it seems important for studying the syntactic and typological foundations of adjectivity. Since the publication of R. Dixon's famous article (Dixon 1977), it has become clear that the morphosyntax of individual lexemes is strongly determined by their semantics.

Semantically, adjectives are notable primarily because many of them (though not all, cf.: `ravnyy` 'equal', `mertvyy` 'dead'…) form gradable meanings. Unlike nominal predicates like 'to be a house', the property denoted by adjectival predicates is structured differently. In the case of 'to be a house', we can divide all objects into houses and non-houses. The meaning 'to be tall' does not contain a precise indication of the cases for which it is true and for which it is false. Simplifying, one can say that some houses will fall under the description `tall house`, some definitely will not, and alongside this, there will be a portion of objects about which it cannot be precisely stated whether they are a `tall house` or not.

Thus, adjectives are characterized by a situation of evaluation, including a subject, a parameter, and circumstances of evaluation. The same house will be tall for one person and not for another; a tall house in a village will differ from a tall house in a city, etc. It is generally accepted that the meaning of adjectives contains not only a reference to a certain state but also a variable characterizing the degree of manifestation of this state (degree variable). The positive degree of an adjective (`vysokiy` 'tall') thus turns out to be semantically more complex than the comparative degree (`vyshe` 'taller'), as it contains an indication that the degree of manifestation of the property defined by the adjective has reached a certain level or "standard" in the given situation (and in the speaker's opinion). We will not delve deeply into the analysis of comparison situations, which have been thoroughly investigated in many works, see (Kennedy, McNally 2005; Ionin, Matushansky 2013; Morzycki 2015) and the literature cited therein.

An important semantic property of adjectives is the ability of the property they denote to change over time. As T. V. Bulygina writes: "A significant characteristic of adjectival and substantive predicates… is their relative independence from time, the absence of clear temporal boundaries for the existence of a connection between the subject and the property attributed to it" (Bulygina 1982: 14). Nevertheless, properties denoted by adjectives: i) can be related to a specific point in time; ii) possess this to varying degrees, cf. `veselyy` 'cheerful', `p'yanyy` 'drunk', `serdityy` 'angry', `kholodnyy` 'cold', on the one hand, and `interesnyy` 'interesting', `umnyy` 'smart', `lyuboznatel'nyy` 'inquisitive', `kruglyy` 'round' – on the other. Adjectives of the first type approximately correspond to states according to (Bulygina 1982) or "stage-level predicates" according to (Carlson 1980). Adjectives of the second type correspond to qualities according to (Bulygina 1982) or "individual-level predicates" according to (Carlson 1980). Adjectives denoting states (`veselyy` 'cheerful', `p'yanyy` 'drunk', `serdityy` 'angry', `kholodnyy` 'cold', etc.) often (though not always) have a cognate perfective verb describing the transition into that state: `poveselt'` 'to cheer up', `op'yanet'` 'to get drunk', `rasserit'sya` 'to get angry', `okhladi'sya` 'to cool down', etc. Adjectives denoting qualities (`interesnyy` 'interesting', `umnyy`⁴, `lyuboznatel'nyy` 'inquisitive', `kruglyy` 'round', etc.) usually do not have similar verbal analogues.

⁴ The situation 'Petya is smart' is not necessarily preceded by the process 'Petya becomes smarter' - Petya could simply have been born smart. However, the situation 'Petya is cheerful' is necessarily preceded by a process described by the verb `(po)veselet'` 'to become cheerful'.

The opposition between stage-level and individual-level predicates introduced by G. Carlson can be reflected in the availability of different interpretations. For example, nominal predications with multiple indefinite noun phrases in the case of the adjective *available* denote an actual state, while with the adjective *intelligent*, they can only be interpreted as universal quantification:

(88) English (Carlson 1980: 74)
a. Doctors are available.
b. Doctors are intellegent.

There are many other variants of how adjective semantics relates to time, connected with the opposition of open and closed scales, etc.

One of the most important semantic characteristics of adjectives began to be discussed thanks to B. Partee's works. The meaning of a number of adjectives when combined with nouns represents the intersection of sets defined by the adjective and noun separately:

(89) English (Partee 1984: 11)
|| carnivorous mammals || = || carnivorous || ∩ || mammals ||
= { x | x is carnivorous and x is a mammal }

Such adjectives are called intersective. There are also other adjectives:

(90) English (Partee 1984: 12)
|| skillful violinist || ≠ || skillful || ∩ || violinist ||
≠ { x | x is skillful and x is a violinist }

The meaning of the noun phrase *skilful violinist* cannot be represented as the intersection of the meanings 'to be skillful' and 'to be a violinist'. Such adjectives are called non-intersective.

An important property of adjectives is also the possibility of restrictive and non-restrictive use. The following English noun phrase has two interpretations:

(91) English (Partee 1984: 6)
the curious student

In the case of the first (non-restrictive / appositive) interpretation, it is asserted that a certain student is curious. The second (restrictive) interpretation helps to establish reference within a certain group of students.

Let us turn to the taxonomy of adjectival meanings. Various approaches to the semantic classification of adjectives have been repeatedly proposed in both Russian and foreign linguistics, see (Bolinger 1967; Givón 1970; Dixon 1977; Shramm 1979; Kharitonchik 1990; Boguslavskaya 2005; Kustova 2009; Karpova et al. 2010; Kyuseva et al. 2013).

One of the most influential works addressing the semantic classification of adjectives was R. Dixon's article (Dixon 1977), see also (Dixon 2004). The identification of semantic classes of adjectives was carried out both on the basis of an analysis of adjective properties in English and taking into account typological material. Dixon established 7 classes of adjectives with similar (within the class) semantic and grammatical properties:

(92) Semantic classes of adjectives according to (Dixon 1977)
Size (`bol'shoy` 'big', `malen'kiy` 'small', `dlinnyy` 'long', `korotkiy` 'short', `shirokiy` 'wide', `uzkiy` 'narrow', …)
Physical properties (`zhestkiy` 'hard', `myagkiy` 'soft', `tyazhelyy` 'heavy', `legkiy` 'light', …)
Color (`chernyy` 'black', `belyy` 'white', `krasnyy` 'red', …)
Human states (`revnivyy` 'jealous', `schastlivyy` 'happy', `dobryy` 'kind', `umnyy` 'smart', `veselyy` 'cheerful', `zhestokiy` 'cruel', …)
Time (`novyy` 'new', `molodoy` 'young', `staryy` 'old', …)
Evaluation (`khoroshiy` 'good', `plokhoy` 'bad', `pravil'nyy` 'correct', `sovershennyy` 'perfect', …)
Speed (`bystryy` 'fast', `medlennyy` 'slow', …)

Dixon's work examined 17 (unrelated) languages with a small number of adjectival lexemes. Based on what meanings are expressed by adjectives in these languages, Dixon identified the most "typologically in-demand" semantic classes. The hierarchy of such typological relevance of adjectival semantics is as follows (from rarer to more frequent meanings):

(93) Semantic types regularly realized as adjectives (Dixon 1977)
Speed
Human states
Physical properties
-----------
Size
Evaluation = Color
Time

Below the line are meanings that have the strongest predisposition to be expressed using adjectives in a given language. It can be said that no matter how few adjectives there are in a given language, these classes (at least partially) will be expressed by adjectives.

Another work dedicated to the classification of adjectives is the monograph (Shramm 1979), based on an analysis of 10,000 adjectives. Adjectives are divided into empirical and rational. Empirical adjectives define properties that are perceived by the senses. Properties introduced by rational adjectives are identified through specific reflection and/or analysis. Adjectives are also subdivided into types depending on the mode of perception:

(94) Classes of adjectives according to (Shramm 1979)
**Empirical**
Vision (`chernyy` 'black', `usatyy` 'mustachioed', `pologiy` 'gently sloping', …)
Hearing (`tikhiy` 'quiet', `gromkiy` 'loud', `bezzvuchnyy` 'silent', …)
Smell (`medvyanoy` 'honey-like', `chadnyy` 'stuffy', `zatkhlyy` 'musty', …)
Taste (`sladkiy` 'sweet', `solenyy` 'salty', `presnyy` 'bland', …)
Touch (`zhidkiy` 'liquid', `goryachiy` 'hot', `sukhoi` 'dry', `myagkiy` 'soft', …)
Muscle tension (`legkiy` 'light', `krepkiy` 'strong', `myagkiy` 'soft', …)
Several organs simultaneously (`yasnyy` 'clear', `rykhlyy` 'loose', `zrelyy` 'ripe', …)

**Rational**
Specific human traits (`sil'nyy` 'strong', `umnyy` 'smart', `unylyy` 'gloomy', …)
Specific animal traits (`porodistyy` 'pedigreed', `odichalyy` 'feral', `khishchnyy` 'predatory', …)
Specific object traits (`smeshannyy` 'mixed', `ustoychivyy` 'stable', `zastoyalyy` 'stagnant', `dolgiy` 'long', …)
Traits of human / animal / objects (`otlichnyy` 'excellent', `simpatichnyy` 'nice', `poleznyy` 'useful', `gadkiy` 'nasty', `krasivyy` 'beautiful', …)

Such semantic types can receive further subdivision with the participation of features 'relates to inanimate object', 'relates to living creature', e.g.: `nerovnaya liniya` 'uneven line', `iskhudalyy chelovek` 'emaciated person', etc. Shramm also identifies a class of Evaluative adjectives with different evaluation criteria.

It seems, however, that a taxonomy built purely on logical grounds or, for example, based on sensory organs, may not manifest in characteristic grammatical properties of individual classes. Below, we will propose a classification of Russian adjectives, partially based on typologically relevant meanings identified by Dixon and subsequent researchers. Another important property for distinguishing classes will be the ability of adjectives to attach specific types of dependents. Relying on the semantic type of the participant denoted by the adjective for classification seems justified, for example, because in the tradition of the Moscow Semantic School, the requirement of valency identity is a condition for lexeme synonymy, see (Apriesyan 1995).

As we will show in Chapter 3, in the area of adjectival government in Russian, there are a number of stable regularities. Adjectives, therefore, can be grouped into classes based on what semantic participants they attach and what marking these participants receive.

Adjectives in Russian serve an extremely wide range of vocabulary – possibly even more extensive than in some European languages. Let's first list the classes of Russian adjectives that can introduce their own participants, and then other significant semantic classes of adjectives in Russian:

   COLOR (`chernyy` 'black', `krasnyy` 'red', `zelenyy` 'green', …)
   TOUCH (`zhidkiy` 'liquid', `goryachiy` 'hot', `sukhoi` 'dry', `myagkiy` 'soft', …)
   HEARING (`tikhiy` 'quiet', `gromkiy` 'loud', `bezzvuchnyy` 'silent', …)
   SMELL (`medvyanoy` 'honey-like', `chadnyy` 'stuffy', `zatkhlyy` 'musty', …)
   TASTE (`syroy` 'raw', `sladkiy` 'sweet', `solenyy` 'salty', `gor'kiy` 'bitter', …)
   WEIGHT (`tverdyy` 'hard', `legkiy` 'light', `krepkiy` 'strong', `myagkiy` 'soft', …)
l. CHARACTER TRAITS AND HUMAN STATES (`revnivyy` 'jealous', `schastlivyy` 'happy', `dobrodushnyy` 'good-natured', `umnyy` 'smart', `veselyy` 'cheerful', `ugryumyy` 'gloomy', …)
m. PLACE (`novgorodskiy` 'Novgorod', `rechnoy` 'river', …)
n. NATIONALITY (`nemetskiy` 'German', `yaponskiy` 'Japanese', …)
o. MATERIAL (`kamennyy` 'stone', `zolotoy` 'golden', …)

In subsequent sections, we will show that elements within one class often demonstrate similarity in grammatical properties. Adjectives of different classes, on the contrary, may be contrasted with each other by their distributional features in Russian or by how they are represented in a given language.

For example, adjectives with the meaning of material exist in Russian but are absent, for instance, in Romance languages. Adjectives with the meaning of nationality are absent in Turkic languages, where they are expressed by a special nominal construction, and so on.

Adjectives of the PLACE, NATIONALITY, and MATERIAL classes are often labeled "relational adjectives" or "properties." Another cliché used in reference to these lexemes describes them as conveying a "property of an object," i.e., relating to a noun. Such adjectives are not characterized by any temporal attribution, neither "strong," as with stage-level adjectives, nor "weak," as with individual-level adjectives. The ability to denote participants, which is important for us in this book, is also absent in these adjectives. On the other hand, such adjectives, if the language has productive mechanisms for their derivation, are extremely numerous, as are the objects to which they relate. Typologically, such classes are often encoded similarly to non-referential possessors⁵.

⁵ Examples are possible where all the mentioned restrictions on the use of denominal adjectives of PLACE, NATIONALITY, and MATERIAL seem to be violated, cf.: `Etot dom stal dlya menya bolee moskovskim v poslednie gody.` 'This house has become more "Moscow-like" for me in recent years.' We will pay some attention to similar cases in Chapter 2, when discussing the structure of the comparative, leaving a more detailed analysis of the semantic and syntactic properties of such uses for the future.

## 1.2.4. Summary: Adjectivity and Attributiveness

We have defined the following set of key contexts for adjectives: i) attributive use; ii) predicative use (including secondary-predicative use); iii) degrees of comparison and forms of intensification. We also noted the importance of derivational morphology used in the formation of units of other PoS from (potential) adjectives.

An adjective can be realized in a given language in one of two ways. On the one hand, adjectives can represent adjectivals, which are characterized by a developed set of grammatical categories. On the other hand, an adjective can also appear in the form of attributives – units capable of functioning as modifiers in a noun phrase.

If a language has a category of adjectivity, then it may also have a category of attributiveness, but not vice versa. In some languages, there is only attributiveness. In other languages, adjectivity may not cover all relevant grammatical categories. As we will show in the subsequent discussion, Russian turns out to be maximally "adjectival" not only by the quantity of adjectives. Russian has an open class of adjectives due to the presence of attributiveness – a productive ability to form attributive wordforms. We will show that Russian is also unique in possessing the full typologically relevant set of grammatical categories for adjectives – special comparative forms and forms specialized for predicative use.

We also described two distributional classes of Russian adjectives. The first type, demonstrated by derivatives with the suffix `-n`, we defined as adjectival. The second, represented by the suffix `-sk`, as attributive. We showed that their properties differ significantly. Adjectivals (feature Adj) are characterized by use in basic contexts characteristic of adjectives: the function of modifier, predicate, and in the context of comparison/intensification. Attributives (feature Atr) can only be used as modifiers.

In the course of further discussion, we will consistently distinguish between adjectives in the narrow sense – the category Adj – and adjectives in the broad sense – the category Atr. Suffixes of the type `-sk` always correspond to adjectives in the broad sense. At the same time, suffixes of the type `-n` can appear in two guises. On the one hand, they can form adjectivals of the Adj category, i.e., possess all the properties listed above: have short forms, morphological comparatives, etc. On the other hand, exactly the same markers in combination with the same stems can be of the Atr category, i.e., not demonstrate these properties. The coexistence of attributives (Atr) parallel to adjectivals is confirmed by examples of adjectives like `kamen-n-yy` 'stone', `blizh-n-iy` 'near', etc., which normally lack short forms, comparatives, etc. The suffix `-n` in such cases is attributive, and forms like `sil'nyy` 'strong' etc. are in fact homonymous.

We have established the main semantic zones of adjectives. For Russian – a language with an extensive adjective category – a maximal set of classes is characteristic, including: EVALUATIVE; TEMPORAL; SPATIAL; IDENTITY; EMOTIONAL RELATION; BENEFACTIVE; KNOWNNESS; TYPICALITY; CONTENT; SIZE; PHYSICAL PROPERTIES (COLOR, TOUCH, HEARING, SMELL, TASTE, WEIGHT); CHARACTER TRAITS AND HUMAN STATES; PLACE; NATIONALITY; MATERIAL. We established that a number of classes and subclasses of adjectives have the greatest "typological predisposition" to be formed as adjectivals, primarily adjectives of EVALUATION, SIZE, COLOR, TIME, as well as HUMAN STATE and PHYSICAL PROPERTIES. We also established that a number of adjectival classes are characterized by the ability to attach their own dependents – this question we will investigate in detail in Chapter 3. Alongside semantic classes of adjectivals, there are also those that are prone to distribution in the form of attributives, primarily the classes of PLACE, NATIONALITY, and MATERIAL; their individual properties will be investigated in Chapter 2. In Chapter 4, attributiveness will be investigated as a syntactic process.

## Chapter 2. Adjectivity

## 2.1. Adjectives in the Noun Phrase Structure

## 2.1.1. Syntactic Status of Adjectives in the Noun Phrase Structure

The structure of a constituent (XP) in modern generative grammar assumes the following elements: head (X⁰), complement (YP), specifier (ZP), adjunct (AP). The head (X⁰) is contrasted with all other elements as non-branching, i.e., not having the status of a phrase:

(97) Constituent structure
<!-- image -->

A complement (YP) is a phrasal dependent whose participation in the projection of the head is determined by the properties of that head. The ability to attach a complement corresponds well to the more traditional notion of valency. The combination of a head and a complement becomes a phrase, i.e., the complement forms the first branching of the head.

Complements can be of two types – lexical (for example, instrumental noun phrases with verbs like `vladet'` 'to own', `upravlyat'` 'to manage', `raspolagat'` 'to possess', etc.) or functional. A functional complement represents the projection of a functional head, i.e., one that carries grammatical information. Examples of "head - functional complement" relationships include the attachment of a finite group (TP) by a complementizer (C): [C `kogda` [TP `pridesh' domoy`]] 'when you come home'; a noun phrase (DP) by a quantifier head Q [Q `all` [DP `the boys`]], etc.

A specifier (ZP) – just like a complement – is "selected" by the head, but it is attached not directly after the head, but at the left edge of the maximal projection (XP). Specifiers are traditionally identified with subjects. Unlike complements, the specifier position does not assign a semantic role.

An adjunct (AP) is a phrase that attaches to some maximal level of projection. Unlike a complement (and some types of specifiers), an adjunct is optional. There can be an unlimited number of adjuncts in the same phrase. The order of multiple adjuncts relative to each other is determined by semantics (not syntactic hierarchy). Adjuncts (with some convention) correspond to adverbs or modifiers in traditional terminology.

Let's start by defining whether an attributive adjective is a head or a phrase. In Russian, full forms (FF) of adjectives with complements are permissible in attributive function:

(98) (internet)
a. Opytnyy gipnotizer smozhet vvesti v gipnoz lyubogo [AdjP soglasnogo [na eto]] cheloveka.
   experienced hypnotist will.be.able introduce into hypnosis any agreeing to this person
   'An experienced hypnotist will be able to hypnotize anyone who agrees to it.'
b. Kazhdyy [AdjP zhenatyy [na inostranke]] muzhchina dolzhen dokazat', chto sposoben obespechit' zhenu.
   every married on foreigner man must prove that able provide wife
   'Every man married to a foreign woman must prove that he is able to provide for his wife.'
c. Ya dazhe ne znayu, gde mozhno nayti [AdjP dovol'nuyu [svoim rostom]] nizkuyu devushku.
   I even not know where can find satisfied by.her height short girl
   'I don't even know where one can find a short girl satisfied with her height.'

In some languages, attributive adjectives cannot attach complements, but the ability to combine with intensifiers seems universal:

(99) English
an [AdjP enormously large] number of combinations
(100) Kalmyk
[ AdjP yir ukhata ] kövün
very smart boy
'very smart boy'

(101) Portuguese
o trabalho [ AdjP mais difícil ]
DEF work most difficult
'the most difficult work'

From the examples above, it can be concluded that attributive adjectives have the status of a phrase, not a head. The following analysis options have been proposed for determining the position of adjectives in the noun phrase, see also the overview in (Pysz 2008).

Firstly, adjectives can be adjuncts in the noun phrase structure, see (Valois 1991; Bouchard 1998; Babby 2009: 74-122; Baker 2003). In (Valois 1991), an analysis is proposed where adjectives occupy an adjunct position of a maximal projection NumP / NP / …, which determines their position in a chain of several adjectives. A similar analysis is proposed in (Bernstein 1993) for a number of attributive adjectives. (Bouchard 1998) raises objections against approaching adjectives as elements ordered by hierarchical structure and/or movement. According to (Bouchard 1998), the principles for ordering adjectives are more semantic than syntactic. This approach will find some confirmation in the results of the study on the order of Russian adjectives presented below. The adjunction of descriptive adjectives in the noun phrase could be represented as shown in (102) (see p. 76).

An adjunct does not change the syntactic type of the projection to which it attaches. This approach seems consistent with the contribution of attributive adjectives to the noun phrase structure. The main disadvantage of considering adjectives as adjuncts

(102) Adjectives as adjuncts in the noun phrase
<!-- image -->

is, perhaps, the inability of such an analysis to explain a certain kind of ordering of attributive adjectives (see below). Such an ordering does not resemble the manifestation of a strict hierarchy, but it certainly exists in some form.

Secondly, according to the approach adopted in the so-called cartographic paradigm, adjectives in the noun phrase can be considered as elements of functional structure, see (Cinque 1993; 2010). With this approach, two analysis options are possible: in (Cinque 1993), adjectives were considered as specifiers of functional projections, see also (Bernstein 1993; Laenzlinger 2000), etc. Cinque, Bernstein, et al. propose that adjectives, primarily adjectives of nationality, are generated in the specifier position of a nominal projection and can express semantic roles. In cases like:

(103) Italian
l'invasione italiana dell'Albania
'the Italian invasion of Albania'

the adjective of nationality is the agent for the action noun `vtorzhenie` 'invasion' and is originally located in the specifier of the projection headed by this noun. After the noun raises, we observe the indicated surface structure:

(104) Italian
l'invasione t [ NP italiana t] dell'Albania

Arguments in favor of locating adjectives in the specifier projection include a fixed linear order in the case of multiple adjectives and a restriction on the number of possible adjectives determined by the set of functional projections. The supposed advantages of such an approach, it seems, are simultaneously its disadvantages: restrictions on order are not truly full-fledged restrictions, and the number of adjectives, it appears, depends only on working memory and parsing ease. The approach to adjectives as specifiers of relevant functional projections can be represented as follows:

(105) Adjectives as specifiers of functional projections
<!-- image -->

In later works, see primarily (Cinque 2010), Cinque tends to view adjectives (of so-called direct modification) as functional heads. This approach harks back to S. Abney's dissertation, who considered attributive adjectives to be A⁰-heads with an NP-complement:

(106) English
(Abney 1987: 208)
[ DP a [ AP [ A proud ] [ NP man ]]]

Cinque proposed that there can be several adjective projections, and they are hierarchically ordered depending on semantics. The lowest adjective in the hierarchy takes the noun phrase as its complement:

(107) Adjectives as heads of functional projections
<!-- image -->

As we saw above, in Russian, examples of attributive adjectives with lexical complements are permissible (`soglasnyy na eto chelovek` 'person agreeing to this', `zhenatyy na inostranke muzhchina` 'man married to a foreigner'), see also the chapter dedicated to argument structure, which provides examples from other languages. Since a single head can only have one complement (whether lexical or functional) – considering adjectives as heads of functional projections is also difficult.

Regardless of whether adjectives are considered specifiers or heads, there is another argument against postulating functional projections of the type Size, Color, etc. Functional projections were conceived as structural elements responsible for checking grammatical features (person, number, tense, aspect, modality, negation, definiteness, etc.). Descriptive adjectives with meanings of size or color do not appear to contain any grammatical feature requiring checking.

A third possibility is to consider the adjective phrase as deriving from a (reduced) relative clause. In English-language literature, such an analysis is primarily associated with (Kayne 1994) and the same foundational work by Cinque (Cinque 1993). Many researchers have been interested in the reasons for the difference in adjective placement in Romance and Germanic languages (postposition and pre-position, respectively). Striving to create a universal structure from which any surface order of attributes could be derived, R. Kayne proposes a structure with a reduced subordinate clause and subsequent noun raising. Kayne suggests that the noun phrase 'yellow book' in French and English (`le livre jaune` and `the yellow book` respectively) begin to be generated identically, occupying a predicate position:

(108) (Kayne 1994: 100-101)
a. le [ CP [C 0 [ TP [ livre ] [I 0 [ jaune ]]]]]
b. the [ CP [C 0 [ TP [ book ] [I 0 [ yellow ]]]]]

In both languages, the adjective then raises to the specifier position of the subordinate clause, Spec, CP:

(109) (Kayne 1994: 100-101)
a. le [ CP [ XP jaune ] j [C 0 [ TP [ livre ] [I 0 [e] j ]]]]
b. the [ CP [ XP yellow ] j [C 0 [ TP [ book ] [I 0 [e] j ]]]]

Finally, in French, the head noun moves to the position of some functional projection F⁰ dominating the relative clause, while in English it remains in situ (see (110) on p. 80).

(110) Adjectives as reduced relative clauses (Kayne 1994: 100-101)
a. French b. English
<!-- image -->

Cinque, see (Cinque 1993), adopts a similar approach for a number of adjectives in the noun phrase, as well as for expanded attributive adjective phrases. In (Cinque 2010), it is assumed that attributive adjectives have two sources. In particular, "adjectives of indirect modification" are formed from a reduced relative clause.

Using Russian language material, the analysis of attributive adjectives as reduced relative clauses was developed by Babby, see (Babby 1973; Babby 1985). According to Babby's approach, the short form (SF) of Russian adjectives, from the perspective of deep syntax, is a full-fledged predicate and behaves like a finite verb form. A consistent chain of transformations translates the structure `Mal'chik, kotoryy bolen anginoy` 'The boy who has a sore throat' into `mal'chik, bol'noy anginoy` 'the boy, sick with a sore throat' and, finally, into `bol'noy anginoy mal'chik` 'the boy sick with a sore throat', see (Babby 1985).

The advantage of the approach to adjectives as the result of relative clause reduction is that it is based on the predicative nature of adjectives. The semantic predicativity of the "adjectival core" of the adjective category is a fact rarely disputed. However, the analysis of adjectives as reduced relative clauses encounters a number of problems, both conceptual and empirical.

Firstly, such an analysis does not significantly advance us toward solving the problem of adjective ordering in the noun phrase (see below). All relative clauses should be formed identically regardless of which predicate (= which adjective) is located at their head. Consequently, ordering multiple adjectives in a noun phrase appears problematic.

Another general problem is the overly complex derivational path and the postulation of heads with unclear semantics and functions (cf., for example, F⁰ in Kayne's scheme).

Furthermore – not all adjectives are possible in predicative position. This property is characteristic, for example, of adjectives whose meaning does not allow intersection with the denotatum of the head noun. Thus, the case `Politsiya poymala vozmozhnogo prestupnika` 'The police caught a possible criminal' does not allow rephrasing as `*Politsiya poymala prestupnika, kotoryy (byl) vozmozhnyy` '*The police caught a criminal who (was) possible', see (Morzycki 2015: 24), etc.

Among the empirical shortcomings of this approach is that it does not describe all facts of the languages to which it can be applied. In particular, only a portion of Russian adjectives possess an SF, which makes attributive use impossible for those adjectives that lack an SF. Furthermore, a number of short and full forms differ semantically in Russian: `vysokoe iskusstvo` 'high art' cannot be formed from `*Iskusstvo (bylo) vysoko` '*Art (was) high', because the SF of `vysokiy` 'high/tall' in Russian only has the meaning of physical extent, etc.

In Russian, the FF can be formed on the basis of the SF, by "adding" a case feature, as proposed in L. Babby's works. However, a number of languages have predicative forms to which attributive adjectives cannot be traced, see, for example, (Pysz 2008) for Old English.

Finally, the fourth approach to attributive adjectives is to consider them predicates of a small clause, see, for example, (Bernstein 1993; Alexiadou, Wilder 1998). A small clause is a projection that has no head but contains only a subject and a predicate:

(111) Small clause
<!-- image -->

A small clause violates the projection principles described above, and it is usually resorted to only in extreme cases when other approaches are even less promising. A significant drawback of this analysis, the least popular among others, is that the noun phrase, a constituent with clearly expressed head properties of one of its elements (the noun), is attributed an evidently exocentric nature.

## 2.1.2. Hierarchy of Attributive Adjectives

The question of the order of adjectives in the noun phrase has been raised by many scholars, see (Dixon 1977; Cinque 1993; Scott 2002; Laenzlinger 2005; Pereltsvaig 2007; Cinque 2010; Valois 2011), et al. It is noteworthy that studies conducted by Russian linguists on Russian material differed in methodology – in (Grashchenkov 2000; Toldova, Mukhanova 2017), statistics were calculated based on corpus data, see also the results presented below.

In the classical work (Dixon 1977), the problem of adjectives in the noun phrase, as far as we know, was explicitly raised for the first time. Dixon's study of adjective order is conducted to confirm the influence of semantics on grammatical properties and typological regularities in the realization of units of the adjective category.

In formal linguistics, the study of the relative order of adjectives to each other and to the head noun also held fundamental importance. One of the important questions that needed clarification was the difference in adjective order in Romance and Germanic languages. In Romance languages, some adjectives are located in post-nominal position, which in (Cinque 1993) was explained as the result of the noun head moving upwards through the noun phrase structure. Additional confirmations of the possibility of noun head movement were put forward in (Longobardi 1994) when analyzing the behavior of proper nouns in Italian. It can be said that the work (Cinque 1993), concerning a seemingly specific issue – the order of adjectives in noun phrases – initiated a series of interesting discussions. Among the most important theoretical problems, at least two can be mentioned: the hypothesis of DP universality, see primarily (Lyutikova 2017b), and the validity of the cartographic idea in general, see (Cinque 2004) and other works.

Below, we will describe a small study of the order of Russian adjectives in the noun phrase, and then compare its results with data from other authors for both Russian and other languages.

## 2.1.2.1. Order of Attributive Adjectives in Russian

We present the results of a study based on a corpus of prose and journalism from the late 20th century, containing a total of approximately 12 million word tokens.

The study was conducted on the following semantic classes of adjectives: SIZE (`bol'shoy` 'big', `uzkiy` 'narrow', …); EVALUATION (`prekrasnyy` 'beautiful', `plokhoy` 'bad', …); TIME (`novyy` 'new', `staryy` 'old'); COLOR (`chernyy` 'black', `krasnyy` 'red', …); MATERIAL (`derevyannyy` 'wooden', `kirpichnyy` 'brick', …); NATIONALITY (`nemetskiy` 'German', `kitayskiy` 'Chinese', …); PLACE (`rossiyskiy` 'Russian', `novgorodskiy` 'Novgorod', …). These classes were chosen for three reasons: first, they are most often the object of description in works on adjective ordering, see (Cinque 2010); second, the semantics of these classes are quite transparent; and third, these lexemes are frequent and allow for a sample of acceptable size.

A total of about 80,000 examples with different types of nominal dependents were extracted, of which about 2,500 were lexemes from the studied classes. Only those pairs of adjectives that had identical grammatical characteristics and were not separated by a comma were programmatically selected.

The following cases were then filtered out: metaphorical uses (`vypuklymi steklyannymi glazami` 'with bulging glass eyes'); examples where the first adjective modifies the second (`glubokogo sinego tsveta` 'of deep blue color'); idioms and terms (`mestnuyu Krasnuyu knigu` 'local Red Book'); cases of ellipsis (`V Peterburge u nikh dva doma - staryy derevyannyy s protechinami i novyy kamennyy na beregu Nevy bliz Letnego sada` 'In St. Petersburg, they have two houses - an old wooden one with leaks and a new stone one on the Neva bank near the Summer Garden') and some others.

Instances of noun phrases consisting of the same elements but in different forms were counted as a single usage (`gromadnymi prozrachnymi kupolami` 'with enormous transparent domes' = `gromadnym prozrachnym kupolom` 'with an enormous transparent dome').

Ultimately, for the chosen semantic classes, 1490 unique examples were obtained, containing 610 non-repeating pairs of adjectives of the following type:

(112) (collection of texts by late 20th-century authors)
a. V dome, krome nego, ostavalsya lish' Purishkevich, kotoryy podnyalsya v kabinet i nabrasyval chto-to v [bol'shom chernom bloknote], vozmozhno, svoyu zavtrashnyuyu rech' v Dume.
   'In the house, besides him, only Purishkevich remained, who went up to the office and sketched something in a [big black notebook], possibly his tomorrow's speech in the Duma.'
b. Ta sidela delovitaya, v [serom angliyskom kostyume], vela razgovor s klientom, uvidela Shevrikuku, vskochila.
   'She sat business-like, in a [gray English suit], conversed with a client, saw Shevrikuka, and jumped up.'
c. …oni preodoleli rasstoyanie v 6700 km i dostigli Kupangi, [nebol'shoy gollandskoy faktorii] na ostrove Timor…
   '…they covered a distance of 6700 km and reached Kupang, a [small Dutch trading post] on the island of Timor…'
d. Imenno ona svoim verdiktom vynosila nedavno obvinitel'nyy prigovor [plokhikh rossiyskim dorogam] i neradivym stroitelyam etikh samykh dorog.
   'It was she who recently, with her verdict, issued a condemning sentence for [bad Russian roads] and the negligent builders of those very roads.'
e. Pozvonil [staryy belyy telefon] s gerbom SSSR.
   'An [old white telephone] with the USSR emblem rang.'

The number of class-grouped pairs was counted. For instance, the SIZE-COLOR order was observed in 773 cases, and the reverse order in 95; the COLOR-MATERIAL order in 6 cases, and the reverse in 5, and so on.⁶ As a result, the following pairs of classes showing significant correlations were formed:

⁶ The data were evaluated in two ways. Firstly, the possibility that the variation results in pairs coincided with an equiprobable distribution (0.5 – half of the cases in direct order, half in reverse order) was checked. If the significance level of such an outcome was below 0.33, the pairs were considered ordered. Additionally, using the χ² criteria (with Yates' correction in case of small expected frequencies) and Fisher's exact test at a significance level of 0.05, the hypothesis that each specific pair was ordered non-randomly was tested.

(113) Ordered pairs of Russian attributive adjectives of different semantic classes
SIZE-TIME; SIZE-EVALUATION; SIZE-COLOR; SIZE-MATERIAL; SIZE-NATIONALITY; SIZE-PLACE; EVALUATION-COLOR; EVALUATION-NATIONALITY; TIME-COLOR; TIME-MATERIAL; TIME-NATIONALITY; TIME-PLACE; COLOR-MATERIAL; COLOR-NATIONALITY

Such pairs of classes are consistently ordered into the following sequence (classes on the same vertical level do not show mutual priority):

(114) Order of Russian attributive adjectives of different semantic classes
SIZE
EVALUATION
TIME
COLOR
MATERIAL NATIONALITY
PLACE

The very fact that no contradictions arise when ordering individual pairs indicates the presence of a hierarchy. As can be seen, adjectives of the semantic class SIZE are located "farthest" from the noun, while adjectives of the classes MATERIAL, NATIONALITY, and PLACE are "closest" to the head noun. The classes EVALUATION and TIME are located after SIZE, followed by COLOR, and then the three final classes.

## 2.1.2.2. Adjective Placement in World Languages and the Syntactic Position of Adjectives in the Noun Phrase

The sequence we obtained for Russian is consistent with the generalization presented by Cinque for Italian (Cinque 1993), and generally true for Romance and Germanic languages, see (Cinque 2010), cf.:

(115) (Cinque 2010: 39)
<!-- image -->

In Cinque's works, see also (Pereltsvaig 2007), et al., it is argued that the order of adjectives in the noun phrase is fixed and universal. It is determined by the hierarchy of functional projections corresponding to different semantic classes of adjectives. Let's analyze the account provided by Cinque for Romance and Germanic languages and show that it cannot describe the observed facts of the Russian language.

Cinque provides the following restrictions on the order of adjectives in the world's languages:

(116) (Cinque 2010: 39)
a. English, Chinese
> A_size > A_color > A_nationality > N
b. * A_nationality > A_color > A_size > N
c. Welsh, Irish
N > A_size > A_nationality > N
d. Indonesian, Yoruba
[ A_size [ A_color [ A_nationality N ] ] ]

In languages like English or Russian, all elements receive surface expression in their base positions. In languages with pre-nominal adjectives, one of two scenarios is possible. On the one hand, the core noun phrase (the noun and some minimal projection of it) can successively raise to the specifier of some higher functional projection – this yields an order of type (c):

(117) (Cinque 2010: 41)
<!-- image -->

Another scenario is movement in the spirit of "pied-piping", see (Testelec 2001: 140-141). In this case, movement occurs on a "snowball" principle: the core noun phrase moves into the node immediately dominating it (AP_nationality), then the entire complex (NP-AP_nationality) raises to the specifier immediately dominating it (AP_color), and so on, thus deriving a structure corresponding to (d):

(118) (Cinque 2010:41)
<!-- image -->

Note that a similar analysis was previously proposed to explain facts of the Greek language, see (Alexiadou, Wilder 1998). As we can see, the inversion of different adjective types according to Cinque is a consequence of the initial movement of the noun phrase's core projection. Russian, utilizing a certain freedom of placement, which seems universally available to adjectives, exhibits variations in order. The examples provided below were obtained within the framework of the experiment described above and correspond to the orders A_nationality > A_color > N; A_nationality > A_size > N and A_color > A_size > N:

(119) (collection of texts by late 20th-century authors)
a. Rezko povernuvshis' na vinte tabureta, ko mne obratilsya nebol'shogo rosta chelovek s [frantsuzskoy chernoy borodkoy]…
   'Turning sharply on the stool's screw, a man of short stature with a [French black goatee] turned to me…'
b. Kak na [yaponskom melkom kalendare], pri smeshchenii ego, voznikaet novaya kartinka…
   'As on a [Japanese small calendar], upon its shifting, a new picture appears…'
c. …gorbun, okazyvaetsya, pristal'no smotrit na menya, a na [krasnykh dlinnykh gubakh] ego bluzhdaet ulybka…
   '…the hunchback, it turns out, looks intently at me, and a smile wanders on his [red long lips]…'

Such variations in order, according to Cinque's proposed mechanism, should be impossible in languages with pre-nominal adjectives, since the adjective phrase cannot move on its own – only with the head of the noun phrase.

Let us mention another study of this problem, conducted for Russian and English adjectives in (Pereltsvaig 2007). The methodology used by A. Pereltsvaig was different⁷: speakers were presented with 30 pairs of adjectives with a presumed "direct" and "reverse" order and asked to evaluate the acceptability of each variant. Cases where the order did not correspond to the investigated hierarchy were assessed as deviations. Few deviations were found (11.5%), but in some pairs, regular "fluctuations" were noted: speakers found it difficult to choose one of the variants.

⁷ Similarly, data on the order of English adjectives were obtained in (Dixon 1977).

Pereltsvaig's study confirms this hierarchy for English and Russian. Our results largely do not contradict the results of (Scott 2002; Pereltsvaig 2007) et al. The main discrepancy is that the SIZE class in our case is positioned before EVALUATION adjectives⁸. The same result for Russian was obtained in (Toldova, Mukhanova 2017), where the order SIZE > EVALUATION was also recorded, and the data for the other classes examined do not contradict our results. (Valois 2011) points to possible variability of the SIZE and EVALUATION classes in Polish.

⁸ It is, of course, also necessary to understand the correspondence of the lexical composition of individual classes. In general, it seems more correct – though less advantageous from the perspective of possible generalizations – to speak of regularities in the arrangement of individual lexemes. Perhaps in the future, it would be worthwhile to conduct a study of the arrangement of certain adjectives using various methods and compare the results.
It should also be noted that in the case of (Pereltsvaig 2007), 30 pairs of adjectives seem insufficient for studying 16 semantic classes: the number of possible combinations for 16 classes is 240 pairs, assuming one lexeme per class.

As we have seen, the variability in adjective order in the Russian noun phrase should hardly be neglected. To the figures given above (SIZE-COLOR - 773/95; COLOR-MATERIAL - 64/5), one can add cases like SIZE-TIME - 22/14; SIZE-MATERIAL - 188/8, etc. The attested examples of reverse order (see above) generally account for about 10%.

The absence of a strict order is demonstrated, for example, by Uralic languages:

(121) Moksha
(Pleshak 2017: 64)
a. Mə̈n' jakšar toštə̑ jupkə̑-m čie-m.
   I red old skirt-ACC wear-NPST-1.SG
b. Mə̈n' toštə̑ jakšar jupkə̑-m čie-m.
   I old red skirt-ACC wear-NPST-1.SG
'I will put on an old red skirt.'

It appears that what we observe in Russian, English, and other languages is in reality not a strict ordering of different types of projections, but rather a tendency towards a specific arrangement. Adjunction is more consistent with regularities of this kind than a hierarchy of functional projections. The following facts speak in favor of adjunction: i) an arbitrary number of adjectives in the noun phrase; ii) a relatively free order of their placement; iii) the absence in individual adjective classes of characteristic grammatical features that would be checked during derivation in a given functional projection.

In some cases, however, the order of attributive modifiers is quite strict. Below, we will analyze common attributive dependents within Mishar noun phrases, which, unlike "ordinary" adjectives, are limited in their variability.

## 2.1.2.3. Position of Attributive Adjectives of Certain Semantic Classes in Old Russian

Let us present the results of another small study, this time related to the diachronic change in word order in the Russian language. The research material was the annotated corpus of the Laurentian Chronicle (14th century), presented in the Syntacticus project⁹. The chronicle text contains approximately 58,000 word forms that received syntactic and other markup. Based on this markup, we identified attributive adjectives (a total of about 2100). For these adjectives, information was collected about their pre- or post-position, as well as the morphological type of the form (FF vs. SF). Manual annotation was performed, allowing for the identification of the semantic classes NATIONALITY and PLACE and their contrast with descriptive adjectives of other classes. Examples of pre-position and post-position of short and full forms of these two classes are given below:

⁹ See http://syntacticus.org

(122) Old Russian
(Syntacticus: Lavr. let.)
a. … probězha lęḑskuyu zemlyu …
   '… ran through the Polish land …'
b . … so vsěmi lyud'mi grech'skimi na vsya lěta …
   '… with all Greek people for all years …'
c. Pridosha pechenězi na rusku zemlyu …
   'The Pechenegs came to the Russian land …'
d. … ponezhe uchilŭ est' yazykŭ slověneskŭ …
   '… because he taught the Slavic language …'

It must be noted immediately that the lexical type of the head (at least at first glance) does not determine the order of adjectives. For example, the nouns `zemlya` 'land' and `yazyk` 'language' allow both pre- and post-position.

A comparison of the quantitative results for the two selected classes and the results for the other descriptive adjectives revealed statistically significant correlations¹⁰. For NATIONALITY and PLACE adjectives, post-positional use (57%) and FF (80%) are more characteristic. Post-position and FF for other classes account for 37% and 69% respectively.

¹⁰ χ² criterion, significance level << 0.01.

Thus, adjectives of the NATIONALITY and PLACE classes tended towards an extreme right-hand position in the noun phrase (post-position) already in Old Russian. This fact itself is quite remarkable. On the one hand, it may suggest that syntactic hierarchies and rules were already in effect in Old Russian and are not a product of linguistic evolution, contrary to (Givón 2009) et al.

On the other hand, the tendency towards post-position of NATIONALITY and PLACE adjectives aligns Old Russian with Romance languages. While in Romance languages the post-position of NATIONALITY adjectives is obligatory, examples from the Laurentian Chronicle demonstrate a preference for post-position for these two classes. Possibly, in both cases, one can assume the operation of the same rules for noun phrase reorganization, which are obligatory in Romance languages and optional in Old Russian.

The restructuring of the noun phrase with adjectives in the history of the Russian language is associated with the emergence of full forms (FF) of adjectives, their stabilization in attributive position, and the specialization of short forms (SF) in non-attributive contexts. The observed data from the 14th century demonstrate the grammaticality of attributive use for both full and short forms in both positions (before and after the noun). The greater preference for FFs shown by the NATIONALITY and PLACE classes, compared to other adjectives, indicates that the introduction of FFs was uneven. It might have begun with individual-level units, which have an "absolute" reading and are located closer to the noun. It is possible that the development of the opposition "attributive FF vs. predicative SF" was precisely facilitated by the fact that attributive forms were more actively used for restrictive, non-evaluative, etc., adjectives. As a consequence, SFs might have specialized in appositive and gradable (uses of) adjectives.

## 2.1.2.4. Grammaticalization of the Position of Extended Constituents in Mishar

In the Mishar dialect of Tatar, as in other Turkic languages, there are a number of markers capable of forming both individual stems and entire constituents, see Chapter 4 for more details. When attached to individual (nominal) stems, such markers generally form gradable adjectives. The order of placement in pairs of derived and non-derived adjectives is relatively free (as in Russian translations):

(123) Mishar
a. keč-le üźin yeget
   strength-ATR tall guy
   'a strong tall guy'
b. üźin keč-le yeget
   tall strength-ATR guy
   'a tall strong guy'

However, if markers like `-lɤ` attach to a constituent, the order becomes fixed:

(124) Mishar
[ ak tap ]- lɤ zur sɤjɤr
white spot-ATR big cow
i) 'a big cow with white spots'
ii) * 'a cow with big white spots'
iii) * 'a big white spotted cow'

(125) Mishar
zur ak tap-lɤ sɤjɤr
big white spot-ATR cow
i) * 'a big cow with white spots'
ii) 'a cow with big white spots' {[ zur ak tap ]- lɤ sɤjɤr }
iii) * 'a big white spotted cow'

As the examples show, placing an attributivized constituent after a single adjective entails a change in meaning. The marker `-lɤ` requires all preceding adjectives to be associated with the stem it modifies (while all adjectives to the right of `-lɤ` relate to the head noun). It appears there are two reasons why extended dependents with `-lɤ` must be located to the left of adjectives.

The first reason is the resolution of syntactic ambiguity. Due to the affix `-lɤ`'s ability to form the preceding material into a single constituent, some dependents before a complex adjective can be interpreted as referring to the stem with `-lɤ`. If the stem with `-lɤ` could be placed to the right of all other material, any utterance containing them would be ambiguous between interpretations i), ii), and iii).

The grammaticalization of the leftward placement of extended constituents thus allows distinguishing cases where `-lɤ` forms a constituent from the use of `-lɤ` as a derivational marker with a single stem.

The second reason why the order "branching first, then non-branching dependents" has been grammaticalized is related to parsing efficiency, see (Hawkins 1990; 1994). To compare the economy of two utterances, John Hawkins proposed using the so-called constituent-to-word-form ratio. This coefficient is calculated as follows: for each word form of a certain constituent, the ratio of the number of constituents awaiting head-attachment to the number of word forms indicating the presence of a head is calculated. The higher this coefficient, the more economically the syntactic structure is processed, as the listener's working memory is engaged to the least extent, and they do not "accumulate" unrecognized constituents.

The following two examples present Mishar noun phrases with leftward extraction of heavy dependents (what actually occurs) and a (hypothetical) structure with an attributivized constituent in situ:

(126) Mishar
zenger küz-le matur kyz
1 / 1 1 / 2 1 / 3 1 / 4 (1 + 1 / 2 + 1 / 3 + 1 / 4) / 4 = 100 %
'a beautiful girl with blue eyes'

(127) Mishar
* [ matur ] [ zenger küz-le ] [ kɤz ]
beautiful blue eye-ATR girl
1 / 1 2 / 2 2 / 3 3 / 4 ( 1 + 1 + 2⁄3 + 3⁄4) / 4 = 85 %
Expected: 'a beautiful girl with blue eyes'

The parsing efficiency in the first case is 100%, and in the second - 85%. The structure in which attributivized constituents are placed before single adjectives turns out to be more economical from the perspective of the listener's working memory. As a consequence, it is this structure that becomes grammaticalized in Turkic languages.

***

To summarize our study of the hierarchy of attributive dependents: i) basic adjectival classes such as SIZE, EVALUATION, TIME, COLOR are more or less universally ordered among themselves in various languages; ii) their order of precedence, however, can hardly be considered strict – we are dealing more with adjunction than with a hierarchy of functional projections; iii) denominal classes MATERIAL, NATIONALITY, PLACE, if expressed in the language by means of adjectives, are also universally located closer to the noun; iv) in the case of attributivized constituents, the order of dependents may obey the rules of syntactic parsing efficiency.

## 2.1.3. Agreement in the Noun Phrase (Concord)

An important aspect of adjectival morphosyntax is the agreement of adjectives within the noun phrase. The term "soglasovanie" (agreement), which in Russian-language literature describes the assimilation of feature values both in the clause and in the noun phrase, has various counterparts in the English-language tradition. When describing agreement in the clause, the term "agreement" is used, while for the noun phrase, the label "concord" is reserved. The difference in terms in this case reflects the different nature of the phenomenon itself – agreement in the noun phrase is only distantly similar to predicative agreement.

An attempt to analyze agreement in the noun phrase analogously to clausal agreement was undertaken in (Carstens 2000). Carstens proposes that the agreement of attributive modifiers is similar to the checking of a case feature in subject and predicate agreement. The noun phrase contains a number of features for which different heads are responsible: the gender feature is assigned by the lexical noun, the number feature by the functional head Num, the person feature by the D projection. The adjective undergoes covert movement at the level of Logical Form (LF) in order to check the corresponding features. The only difference from case agreement, according to Carstens, is the following: in the case of case (of the subject), movement is motivated by uninterpretable features of the agreement target, while in the case of nominal agreement, it occurs to check uninterpretable features of the source, i.e., the adjective itself.

Norris (Norris 2014) holds a similar view on the localization of features relevant to the noun phrase. From his perspective, each feature is governed by a corresponding functional or lexical head: D for the case feature, Num for the number feature, N for the gender feature. Contrary to Carstens, however, Norris considers nominal agreement a separate phenomenon. Agreement in the noun phrase – unlike case agreement (of the subject) – does not depend on the position of the agreeing elements. All modifiers capable of conveying the value of a certain feature must acquire it regardless of their position. The mechanism responsible for such agreement is feature percolation / spread. Gender and number features percolate upwards through the noun phrase structure, causing, for example, gender and number agreement in Romance languages. The case feature, on the other hand, percolates downwards from D through the structure, being expressed by all heads for which it is morphologically relevant – cf. Russian, Estonian, and other languages with morphological case.
Thus, for languages with attributive adjective agreement, the following approach can be adopted. Individual levels of noun phrase projection are responsible for specific grammatical features (D - case / definiteness, Num - number, N - gender / class, etc.). After the corresponding level enters the derivation, the values of grammatical features become relevant for all elements of the noun phrase. Furthermore, if our language is one with attributive agreement, grammatical features must be marked on every element of the noun phrase, including on adjectives.

However, agreement in the noun phrase, as is known, is a parameter of typological variation. Russian prohibits the use of modifiers without an agreement position: *`khaki kurtka` 'khaki jacket', *`lyuks otel'` 'luxury hotel'. Such indeclinable units can be used attributively within genitives of quality¹¹: `kurtka tsveta khaki` 'jacket of khaki color', `otel' klassa lyuks` 'hotel of luxury class', etc. In the examples from other languages provided below, adjectives are also obliged to reflect grammatical categories relevant to the noun phrase:

(128) Estonian
need punased õunad
this.NOM.PL red.NOM.PL apple.Nom.Pl
'these red apples'

(129) French
grand-e-s maison-s vert-e-s
big-F-PL house-PL green-F-PL
'big green houses'

(130) Danish
(Norris et al. 2014: 627)
det stor-e gul-e håndklæde
DEF big-DEF yellow-DEF towel
'the big yellow towel'

(131) Swahili
(Carstens 2016: 7)
kitabu ki-zuri sana
book(7) 7-good very
'a very good book'

(132) Bagvalal
c'inu=b mašina
new=N machine
'a new car'

¹¹ For genitives of quality, see section 4.4.

In the Estonian example, adjectives copy the values of number and case; in French, gender and case; in Danish, definiteness; in Swahili, class; and in Bagvalal, number and class. It should be noted that despite Bagvalal, like other Dagestanian languages, having a developed case system, adjective agreement in case is (practically) absent.

In many languages, however, attributive adjectives do not receive any grammatical markers:

(133) Tubalar
…t'aš kiž-ler-ni qar-a su-p-ler
young person-PL-ACC snow-DAT hide-PRES-3.PL
'…they bury young people in the snow.'

(134) Kalmyk
(Internet)
shin degtr-müd-in tusk survr-mud
new book-PL-GEN about question-PL
'questions about new books'

(135) Moksha
(Pleshak 2017: 64)
Mə̈n' toštə̑ jakšar jupkə̑-m čie-m.
I old red skirt-ACC wear-NPST-1.SG
'I will put on an old red skirt.'

(136) Circassian
Pase zemany-m adyge-khe-m zy khabze ya-I-et.
early time-ERG Adyghe-PL-ERG one custom 3.PL.AG-have-REL.PAST
'In former times, the Adyghe people had such a custom.'

As we can see, adjectives in the noun phrases of Tubalar, Kalmyk, Moksha, and Circassian do not express any grammatical information. All grammatical markers relevant to noun phrases in these languages are located on the nominal head, which is at the end of the nominal constituent. In this regard, the following questions arise: i) Is the "non-agreement" strategy only related to the absence of corresponding morphology on the adjective, or does the absence of agreement also extend to nouns? ii) What do grammatical markers mark in the absence of agreement – only the nominal head or the entire nominal constituent?

We believe that grammatical markers (case, number, etc.) in languages without noun phrase agreement attach to the entire noun phrase, and the absence of a position for expressing agreement is characteristic not only of adjectival word forms but also of nouns. We will provide two arguments in favor of this approach.

Firstly, when substantivized in such languages, adjectives necessarily express all the same grammatical meanings as nouns:

(137) Tubalar
Men kara-tar-nɨ köre-m.
I black-PL-ACC see-1.SG
'I saw some black ones.'

The example from Tubalar shows that adjectives, in the absence of a noun, can freely take number and case markers. Consequently, the point is not at all that nouns in such languages have a morphological position for expressing grammatical meanings while adjectives do not.

Furthermore, if an adjective appears in the noun phrase after the noun, then grammatical markers are expressed on the adjective, not the noun. Above, we observed that in Circassian, the ergative marker can express a locative meaning, marking the (final) noun in the noun phrase 'in former times'. The following Circassian example contains a noun phrase in which the adjective is placed after the noun:

(138) Circassian
Gu ts'yq'w-m i-ri-ɣe-t'ysḥe-r-i
cart small-ERG LOC-3.SG.AG-CAUS-sit-ABS-AOR
y adә-r ḥwəmurə bgy-m n-i-še-sa-ś.
his father-ABS quietly mountain-ERG DIR-3.SG.AG-carry-LOC-AOR
'He put his father in the small cart and quietly drove him to the mountain.'

As we can see, the ergative (also with a locative meaning) here attaches to the adjective, or rather, it still marks the end of the nominal constituent. In Basque, adjectives are always in post-position and also take all grammatical markers:

(139) Basque
Aitak bi zuhaitz zaharr-i adarrak moztu
father two tree old-DAT branches cut
z-i-zki-e-n.
3.SG-DAT-3.PL-3.PL-PST
'The father cut the branches from two old trees.'

The situation is similar in the Sino-Tibetan language Manang, where adjectives are also in post-position and take case marking:

(140) Manang
(Genetti, Hildebrandt 2004: 90)
²kyu ¹thyʌ-pʌ=ri ¹thē¹tʌ-tsi.
water big-NMN=LOC throw become-PFCT
'They throw [it] into the big water.'

As we can see, we are faced with two types of languages. On the one hand, languages that have a special position in the word form structure (adjectival, nominal, etc.) allowing the expression of relevant grammatical categories. On the other, languages without such a position.

It can be assumed that in languages like Russian or Estonian, the adjective word form contains a special marker responsible for the agreement mechanism. Such an analysis was substantiated in (Halle, Matushansky 2006) using Russian data. Halle and Matushansky propose that the Russian adjectival word form contains a special functional element, phonologically realized as `oj` and responsible for adjectives expressing the category of case:

(141) (Halle, Matushansky 2006: 360)
STEM + oj + AGR

This element is contained in the morphological structure of FF adjectives, which allows full forms to express case grammeme values. Short forms do not have such an element in their word form structure and are, accordingly, deprived of this possibility. According to (Halle, Matushansky 2006), both FF adjectives and nouns have similar thematic markers. In the case of adjectives, the presence of this morpheme is, in fact, responsible for attributive usage.

Thus, in the case of languages with agreement, a functional element (labeled as `adj` in the diagram below) responsible for agreement and attributive usage can be established. It can be argued that in languages without agreement, word forms (both adjectival and nominal) do not contain a position responsible for copying grammatical features, and the relevant grammatical markers mark the entire noun phrase. The A projection, responsible for attributive usage, is universal and present in the word form structure of any language:

(142) Languages with agreement (Russian, Estonian, …)
[ NP … [ adj [ adj {number,case, …} ] [ A A [ Adj Adj]]] … [N NOUN]]

(143) Languages without agreement (English, Tubalar, …)
[ NP … [ A A [ Adj Adj]] … [N NOUN]]-{number,case, …}

It is noteworthy that in Russian, the belonging of a lexeme to the adjective class is not linked to the agreement head [adj]. On the contrary, the fact that a certain unit belongs to this class allows it to attach [adj]. Stems that either inherently contain an indication of belonging to the adjectival category or are marked with the corresponding marker (`-n`, `-sk`, …) gain the ability to express agreement.

The secondary nature of agreement and attributive usage in relation to belonging to the adjective class can be confirmed by the following reasoning. A number of Russian adjectives do not have an FF: `rad` 'glad', `prav` 'right' (in the sense of 'correct'), `velik` 'great', `mal` 'small' (in the sense of size). Abstract nouns formed from them are `pravota` 'righteousness', `velichina` 'magnitude', `radost'` 'joy', `malost'` 'smallness'. One of these suffixes, `-ot`, equally serves to form nouns from both adjectives and verbs, cf.: `temnota` 'darkness', `bednota` 'poverty' (deadjectival derivation); `rabota` 'work', `toshnota` 'nausea' (deverbal derivation). The suffix `-in` forms nouns from both adjectives and nouns: `lysina` 'bald patch', `bokovina` 'side part'; `baranina` 'mutton', `goroshina` 'pea'. At the same time, the suffix `-ost'` is strictly deadjectival: `starost'` 'old age', `strogost'` 'strictness', `yasnost'` 'clarity', `oblachnost'` 'cloudiness', etc. It can be concluded that the derivational morphology forming nouns from adjectives that only have SFs either coincides with that for verbs and nouns or is specialized for servicing adjectives. The reverse situation – where a certain marker, specialized for some other part of speech, is used for adjectives without an FF – is not observed.

Thus, it can be said that "attributivity does not make the adjective," but rather an adjective may or may not be attributive. The very fact of the existence of Russian SFs like `rad`, `prav`, `velik`, `mal`, etc., also confirms this thesis.

Summarizing what has been said, the structure of an attributive word form in Russian can be represented as follows:

(144) Structure of FF adjectives in Russian
<!-- image -->

where A is a functional head responsible for attributive usage (see below), adjP is a functional head responsible for agreement inflection. The adjP head can take an adjective stem of one of two types: Adj - an adjective, a proper adjective, or Atr - an attributive. The impossibility of constructing a word form with agreement inflection from heads not marked as Adj or Atr follows automatically – A takes as its complement only stems of one of these two categories¹².

¹² One exception to this rule will be discussed in section 4.4.

The necessity of marking a stem with the categorical feature Adj or Atr can be demonstrated by the following example¹³. Borrowed stems in Russian cannot simply be used with inflection, but must first be additionally marked with an adjectivizer (`normal'nyy` 'normal', `real'nyy` 'real', `virtual'nyy` 'virtual', …) or an attributivizer (`arkhaicheskiy` 'archaic', `tayskiy` 'Thai', `vegetarianskiy` 'vegetarian', …). Note that English or French `norm-al` or French `archa-ïque` are already adjectives in the source language and even contain a recategorizing suffix (`-al`, `-ïque`). However, morphological features of another language are opaque to Russian, and adjectives must be marked again:

(145) Borrowings marked with an adjectivizer
<!-- image -->

(146) Borrowings marked with an attributivizer
<!-- image -->

Furthermore, belonging of a lexeme to adjectives (category Adj) allows it to possess the full set of adjectival properties characteristic of adjectives in Russian: forming short forms,

¹³ See also section 1.2.2.

degrees of comparison, etc. Belonging of a lexeme to attributives (Atr) is ensured by suffixes like `-sk`, etc. – these suffixes only allow stems to function as agreeing modifiers within a noun phrase.

Let us say a few words about the nature of the head A, responsible for attributive usage. In languages without nominal agreement, despite the absence of a projection responsible for agreement features in the word form structure, attributivity is nevertheless a positively defined feature. In other words, not every unit can be used as a modifier in a noun phrase, but only one that is marked as an adjective. This can be demonstrated with the following example from the Tatar language.

In Tatar, as in other Turkic languages, adjectival and nominal lexemes may not differ morphologically. Information about which category a stem belongs to is nevertheless accessible during syntactic derivation. In the examples below, a lexeme of one type (the adjective `zur`) can be used as a modifier in a noun phrase, while a lexeme of another type (the noun `kayen`) cannot. To use a noun as a modifier, it is necessary to form a so-called izafet construction – case (148b):

(147) Tatar
zur botak
big branch
'big branch'

(148) Tatar
a. * kayen botak
   birch branch
b. kayen bota-gy
   birch branch-3
   'birch branch'

Thus, the function of head A is to license the use of a certain unit as a pre-nominal attribute.

Below, we will examine a typologically widespread construction in which nouns can also function as pre-nominal attributes. As we will show, however, such uses do not transform nouns into adjectives.

## 2.1.4. Attributivity Without Recategorization: MATERIAL and NATIONALITY Classes

English is known for its productivity in the area of so-called nominal compounds: `travel agency` – 'travel agency', `quality product` – 'quality product'…, and compounds: `ice-cream` – 'ice cream', `headache` – 'headache'…, see (Marchand 1955; Baker 2003: 202; Booij 2007; Lieber, Stekauer 2009), et al. Alongside this, there exists one typologically extremely widespread model, observed both in English and beyond. This refers to appositive modifiers with the meaning of material. Such modifiers in many languages are formed by unmarked contact juxtaposition of a noun with the meaning of the derived material and the head:

(149) English
stone wall
'stone house'

(150) Circassian
pχe wəne
wood house
'wooden house'

(151) Mongolian
(Orlovskaya 1961: 4)
temer khurz
iron shovel
'iron shovel'

(152) Tatar
aǧach küper
wood bridge
'wooden bridge'

(153) Burmese
(Mazo 1978)
Svej² thi³
gold umbrella
'golden umbrella'

(154) Komi
(A. P. Leont'yev, p.c.)
bumaga kerob-ys
paper box-3.SG
'paper boxes'

As can be seen from the translations, in Russian, adjectives of the MATERIAL class form a similar meaning. Typologically, this does not seem to be the most common strategy. The appositive attributes given above, or the marking of the modifier with a genitive marker, appear to be more regular.

Looking at the examples from this language sample, one might assume that the meaning of material is encoded by nominal appositives in languages where noun phrase agreement is absent. However, German and Greenlandic examples refute this regularity. These languages have both appositive constructions with the meaning of material and agreement in the noun phrase:

(155) German
(Ye. A. Lyutikova, p.c.)
a. Steinmauer
   stone.wall
   'stone wall'
b. großer Baum / großes Mädchen
   tall.N.SG.NOM tree / tall.F.SG.NOM girl
   'tall tree' / 'tall girl'

(156) Greenlandic
(Fortescue 1984: 108, 118)
a. illirviusaq qisuk
   box wood
   'wooden box'
b. qimmi-t qaqurtu-t
   dog-PL white-PL
   'white dogs'

The order of material appositives and adjectives is also noteworthy. The similarity of these types of dependents is complemented by the fact that in languages with post-position, both types of modifiers are placed after the noun:

(157) Greenlandic
(Baker 2003: 183-184)
a. illirviusaq qisuk * qisuk illirviusaq
   box wood wood box
   'wooden box'
b. ilinniartitsisoq franskeq * franskeq ilinniartitsisoq
   teacher French French teacher
   'French teacher'

Appositives with the meaning of material also resemble adjectives in that they possess a certain lexical freedom. Firstly, appositives, like adjectives, can bear independent stress, see (Jespersen et al. 1954: 135; Marchand 1955: 222). Secondly, as stated, for example, in (Plag 2003: 192), the interpretation of noun phrases with material appositives is quite free: `marble museum` can mean 'museum of marble', 'museum built of marble', etc.

On the other hand, as can be seen from the German and Greenlandic examples, material appositives differ from adjectives in the absence of agreement with the head. There are other differences that, in our opinion, prevent considering material appositives a subclass of adjectives even in languages like English, where they do not agree with the head. Let us list some of them.

The position of material appositives in the noun phrase is generally restricted: they must be in direct contact with the head noun. Let's give an example from Tatar:

(158) Tatar
a. zur aǧach küper
   big wood bridge
b. * aǧach zur küper
   wood big bridge
'big wooden bridge'

Coordination, permissible for two adjectives, is ungrammatical for an adjective and a material appositive:

(159) Kazakh
a. eski aǧash üy
   old wood house
   'old wooden house'
b. eski zhəne apatty üy
   old and dilapidated house
   'old and dilapidated house'
c. * eski zhəne aǧash üy
   old and wood house
   'old and wooden house'

Furthermore, unmarked dependent nouns in English noun phrases can form quite extended constituents, cf.:

(160) English
(Booij 2007: 76)

In the case of dependents with the meaning of material, however, branching is impossible, cf.:

(161) English
a. * thousand stone(s) wall
   thousand stone(PL) wall
   Expected: 'a wall of a thousand stones'
b. old stone wall
   old stone wall
   i) 'an old stone wall'
   ii) * 'a wall of old stone'

This, it seems, is one of the significant differences between material appositives and adjectives. Adjectives (even) in English allow (left-placed) dependent material, cf. `very nice girl`, `extremely strange person`, …

Another difference between the use of adjectives and appositive nouns with the meaning of material is the former's ability and the latter's inability to function as predicates:

(162) English
a. The wall was high.
   'The wall was high.'
b. * The wall was stone.
   Expected: 'The wall was stone.'
c. The wall was from stone.
   'The wall was from stone.'

The independent stress and fixed lexical meaning suggest that such structures, like noun phrases with adjectives, are generated in the syntax, not in the lexicon. At the same time, the fixed position of material appositives, their inability to be used with dependents, and their inability to function as the nominal part of a predicate indicate the limited syntactic context of their use.

The properties of material appositive nouns indicate that they are X⁰ (not XP) dependents within the noun phrase. Moreover, nothing indicates a change in the categorical status of such dependents – it can be argued that they do not undergo recategorization but remain nouns. The structure of noun phrases with them appears as follows:

(163) English
[ NP [ AP old ] [ NP stone [ N house ]]]
<!-- image -->

Thus, the case of material appositives is associated with the adjunction of a dependent nominal head. In this case, no recategorization occurs (the Adj feature does not change to N), and the structure of the dependent word form lacks the head A, which is responsible for attributive usage.

There is also another strategy for marking the meaning of material in world languages, related to the use of the genitive. For example, in Hindi, the same means used for expressing possessivity is employed to encode material relations:

(164) Hindi
a. patter ki diwwar
   stone GEN wall
   'stone wall'
b. lakari kā pul
   wood GEN bridge
   'wooden bridge'

The meaning of material is expressed using the genitive, for example, in Georgian:

(165) Georgian
Mtaze dgas x-is saxli.
on.mountain stands wood-GEN house
'A wooden house stands on the mountain.'

The NATIONALITY adjective class is also absent in many languages. In this case, the expression of the NATIONALITY meaning is carried out in the same way as the encoding of non-referential possessivity. Let's provide examples from Turkish:

(166) Turkish
a. Türk sınız-ı
   Turk border-3
   'Turkish border'
b. Türk sanat-ı
   Turk art-3
   'Turkish art'

The status of such nominal dependents differs from material appositives. In Turkic languages, they presumably form a nominal projection larger than NP (and even NumP), but smaller than DP, see (Lyutikova, Pereltsvaig 2014a; 2014b). Referential noun phrases at the DP level form very similar constructions, which, however, must be marked with the genitive:

(167) Turkish
a. Türk-ler-in sınız-ı
   Turk-PL-GEN border-3
'border of the Turks'

b. Türk-ler-in sanat-ı
   Turk-PL-GEN art-3
   'art of the Turks'

A similar distinction between the attributive meaning of nationality and a referential possessor is found in Mongolic languages¹⁴:

(168) Buryat
(A. A. Serebryannikova, p.c.)
a. Orod ger soo gurban komnata.
   Russian house in three room
   'There are three rooms in the Russian house.'
b. Orod-oi ger soo gurban komnata.
   Russian-GEN house in three room
   'There are three rooms in the house of (this) Russian (person).'

¹⁴ The difference between Mongolic and Turkic languages is that Mongolic languages have a differently organized head-marking ("izafet") system.

Thus, many languages encode the MATERIAL and NATIONALITY classes by employing various strategies for marking the dependency of one noun on another.

## 2.1.5. Summary: Attributivity as a Basic Function of the Adjective

We have examined the use of adjectives in the function of an attribute. As we hypothesized, the word form structure of any language possessing an independent adjectival class includes a head responsible for attributive usage (A).

Some languages additionally have a morphological head responsible for expressing features of gender/class, number, definiteness, case, etc. Speaking of the attributive marker A, we can try to make a higher-level generalization. One conclusion we have reached (it seems, along with generative linguistics of the last six decades) is that the attributive use of an adjective can hardly be reduced to the predicative one. Indeed, the ordering of various semantic classes of adjectives is difficult to explain as a result of "reduction" of relative clauses or other predicative structures. Whatever the status of attributive adjectives in the noun phrase – adjunction (most likely) or something else – attributive usage is syntactically elementary and typologically universal. If this is so, then languages can differ depending on whether they possess a special part of speech capable of attaching head A without additional marking. If yes, we are dealing with a language with adjectives. If not, then head A can participate in participial formations from the class of stative verbs. The encoding of meanings correlatable with nouns is more complex.

It seems that participles, as a means of expressing the attributive dependency of a verb on a noun, are universal to varying degrees. The situation is different with nouns. In many languages, some marking on the noun for dependency on another noun may be absent – see the discussion of the MATERIAL and NATIONALITY classes. To encode the dependency of a noun on a noun, juxtaposed heads, possessive markers, incomplete nominal projections, etc., can be used. Syntax, therefore, provides various alternative means of organizing attributive relations between two nouns. Typologically and diachronically, this is expressed as follows: the marking of attributive dependency for stative lexemes of the SIZE, EVALUATION, COLOR, TIME classes leads to these very (verb-related) units forming the basis of a newly formed adjectival category. This is how "adjectives in the narrow sense," i.e., adjectivals, are obtained. If the encoding of attributive dependency extends further, to the domain of various prenominative meanings, we get attributives, "adjectives in the broad sense."

Russian has followed both paths and is a language with a "rich" class of adjectives due to the fact that, in addition to adjectival meanings, it has the possibility of regularly forming attributives. Russian adjectivals, in turn, possess the maximum functionally available for adjectives typologically – this point of view will be substantiated by us later in this chapter. When discussing the organization of the Russian adjective word form, we established that some agreeing attributive forms are formed as an adjectival projection (Adj), and some as an attributive projection (Atr). Russian attributives, i.e., lexemes with the Atr feature, often have no analogues as adjectives in other languages (cf. the MATERIAL and NATIONALITY classes).

## 2.2. Adjectives as the Predicate of a Simple Sentence

## 2.2.1. The Chicken and Egg Problem: Predicative and Attributive Use of Adjectives

In the classic work (Bolinger 1967), the semantics of adjectives is investigated depending on the position in which they are used. D. Bolinger discusses the derivational approach to attributive adjectives adopted in early generativism. According to this approach, adjectives are originally generated in a predicative position, then undergo transformation into a relative clause, after which the relative clause is first reduced to post-position, and then transformed into pre-position. As Bolinger notes, however, many adjectives demonstrate a regular semantic contrast in pre- and post-position, allowing for homonymy in the predicate position, cf.:

(169) English
(Bolinger 1967: 3-4)
a. the only navigable river
   'the only navigable river' - permanent property
b. the only river navigable
   'the only navigable river' - manifestation of quality (now) at the moment
c. The only river that is navigable is to the north.
   'The only navigable river is to the North.' - i) permanent characteristic; ii) temporary characteristic

Adjectives like `guilty`, `visible`, and many others behave similarly.

Bolinger distinguishes two types of adjective usage: modification of the referent and modification of reference. Modification of reference is characteristic of the adjective's use in a noun phrase, while modification of the referent is for predicative use. Thus, the noun phrase `a criminal lawyer` corresponds to the meaning 'a lawyer who deals with criminal law'; here, modification of reference occurs. In nominal predication `The lawyer is criminal`, the adjective's meaning corresponds to modification of the referent: 'This lawyer is criminal (engages in criminal activity)'.

For a number of adjectives, only modification of reference is available, but not modification of the referent:

(170) English
(Bolinger 1967: 18-20)
a true poet vs. * The poet is true.
'a true poet' vs. '*The poet is true.'
a regular champion vs. * The champion is regular.
'a regular champion' vs. '*The champion is regular.'
our prime suspect vs. * The suspect is prime.
'our prime suspect' vs. '*The suspect is prime.'
the future king vs. * The king is future.
'the future king' vs. '*The king is future.'

At the same time, Bolinger distinguishes a class of so-called a-adjectives in English (many of which, surprisingly, begin with `a`): `afraid`, `alike`, `alive`, `agog`, `aware`, etc. Such adjectives can only be used predicatively.

It should be noted that the difference in interpretation of the same adjectivals when used as an attribute and as a predicate appears typologically quite universal. This is demonstrated by the following examples from Vietnamese (which is an analytic language with stative adjectives):

(171) Vietnamese

|    | 'yellow eyes'   |               | 'to turn yellow with the eyes' (from fatigue, etc.)                                                         |

The attributive (normally post-positional) use of Vietnamese adjectives corresponds to a static / individual-level interpretation. At the same time, predicative use (examples with a prime mark) implies a stage-level / dynamic reading. The difference in the semantics of attributive and predicative adjectives thus appears universal (we will also provide examples from Russian later).

Bolinger's observations challenged the derivational approach to attributive adjectives that existed at the dawn of generativism. Bolinger not only considered attributive usage irreducible to predicative usage but, moreover, suggested that attributive usage is primary for adjectives.

In Russian, as is known, there is a short form specialized for predicative use. As we will show below, the predicative use of the full form, although grammatical, actually traces back to the attributive.

As we know, the approach to the attributive position as derived from the predicative one has long ceased to be standard in generative grammar; see, for example, the monographs (Baker 2003; Cinque 2010), which have recently become classics. Both Baker and Cinque do not consider any of the adjective's positions – attributive or predicative – to be basic.

M. Baker derives the ability of adjectives – and only them, not nouns or verbs – to modify nouns from the functional load proposed in his theory for each lexical category. Nouns and the category N are considered responsible for correlating a linguistic unit with a referential index, which contributes to establishing extra-linguistic reference. Verbs and the category V are considered by Baker responsible for assigning a semantic role. Each of these properties is unique to each of these categories. Adjectives, in Baker's opinion, are capable neither of independently realizing reference nor of assigning a semantic role and are, therefore, a negatively defined category. The attributive use of a noun is prevented by the fact that a single noun phrase would have two referential indices. The attributive use of a verb is prevented by the fact that, due to the definition having a semantic role, the noun phrase would be marked with a V index, see (Baker 2003: 193-199). Consequently, attributive use is available only for adjectives. Baker derives the ability of adjectives to be used attributively precisely from their lack of any additional functional load.

(Cinque 2010) investigates the syntax and semantics of various attributive positions of adjectives. All adjectives are subdivided into directly-modifying and indirectly-modifying. Directly-modifying adjectives are placed before the noun in Germanic languages and after it in Romance languages. Directly-modifying adjectives are associated with an individual-level interpretation; they are non-restrictive, have an "absolute" meaning (`большой дом` 'big house' = 'the house is big', but not 'the house is big compared to others'), are non-intersective (`старший оперуполномоченный` 'senior detective' ≠ 'senior' ∩ 'detective'), etc. Directly-modifying adjectives are located closer to the noun and are more strictly ordered relative to the nominal head. Indirectly-modifying adjectives derive from predicative usage, essentially representing reduced relative clauses. Accordingly, they are stage-level, restrictive, have a "relative" meaning (`выдающийся исследователь` 'outstanding researcher'), are intersective (`прекрасная танцовщица` 'beautiful dancer' = 'beautiful' & 'dancer'), are located further from the noun, are less strictly ordered, etc. The approach developed by Cinque, to a certain extent, inherits the distinction proposed in (Bolinger 1967) between modification of reference and modification of the referent.

In summary: both functions, attributive and predicative, can be considered key for the adjectival category.

## 2.2.2. Stativity

In some languages, adjectives in the predicate position can receive person and number markers:

(172) Karachay-Balkar
a. Men aqylli-ma.
   I smart-1.SG
   'I am smart.'
b. Sen aqylli-sa.
   you smart-2.SG
   'You are smart.'
c. Ol aqylli-dy.
   he smart-3.SG
   'He is smart.'

(173) Buryat
a. Bi sesen-bi.
   I smart-1.SG
   'I am smart.'
b. Shi sesen-shi.
   you smart-2.SG
   'You are smart.'
c. Badma sesen-∅.
   Badma smart-3.SG
   'Badma is smart.'

One might assume that adjectives and verbs in Karachay-Balkar and Buryat share common grammatical categories. However, this is not entirely true. Firstly, nouns also have the same person-number markers (for brevity, we will omit further examples from Buryat, which would be structured similarly to Karachay-Balkar):

(174) Karachay-Balkar
a. Men ustaz-ma.
   I teacher-1.SG
   'I am a teacher.'
b. Sen ustaz-sa.
   you teacher-2.SG
   'You are a teacher.'
c. Ol ustaz-dy.
   he teacher-3.SG
   'He is a teacher.'

Moreover, adjectives in such languages are not capable of synthetically expressing aspect-tense categories, and in cases where this is necessary, they use copulas:

(175) Karachay-Balkar
a. Men aqylli bollyq-ma.
   I smart be.FUT-1.SG
   'I will be smart.'
b. Sen aqylli bollyq-sa.
   you smart be.FUT-2.SG
   'You will be smart.'
c. Ol aqylli bollyq-dy.
   he smart be.FUT-3.SG
   'He will be smart.'

It can be concluded that cases of adjectives (and nouns) being marked with person-number markers in such languages correspond to the use of a zero existential copula.

So-called languages with statives or qualitative verbs are structured differently. Meanings conveyed by adjectives in European languages correspond grammatically to verbs in such languages. Below, we will analyze two languages with statives: Archi and Nivkh.

Lexemes with adjectival semantics in these languages form the same forms as verbs. In Nivkh, qualitative statives can function as predicates of a finite clause without a copula and must, in such a case (like verbs), be marked with mood indicators and agree in number:

(176) Nivkh
(Gruzdeva 2012: 467)
a. Ţ'əŋ-q q'av-ḑ.
   stove-Q be.hot-IND
   'The stove is hot.'
b. Tamk-xun tak-nt-γun.
   hand-PL be.warm-IND-PL
   'The hands are warm.'

In the attributive function, both qualitative and other verbs are either unmarked or receive the marker `-la`, see (Otaina 1976: 117; Nedyalkov, Otaina 2011: 42)¹⁵. Let's provide an example of unmarked usage:

(177) Nivkh
(Nedyalkov, Otaina 2011: 42)
a. Paḥ t'osq-t'.
   stone crack-IND
   'The stone cracked.'
b. T'osq vaḥ kut-t'.
   cracked stone fall-IND
   'The cracked stone fell.'

In the examples above, the dynamic verb 'to crack' is used in the form of a finite predicate and an unmarked attributive modifier. The same uses are available for the qualitative verb 'to be big':

(178) Nivkh
(Gruzdeva 2012: 477)
If pil-yvo ch'omsomy-yvu-d'.
he be.big-CONV be.silent-PROG-IND
'Growing up, he becomes silent.'

(179) Nivkh
(Nedyalkov, Otaina 2011: 50)
Imṇ pila eri ukh ch'oṇyṇd'.
they big river on fish caught
'They fished on the big river.'

The stative 'to be big' is used in the first example as a dependent predicate in the form of a converb, and in the second, as an attributive modifier.

In addition, adjectival statives can attach various aspectual markers, see (Gruzdeva 2012), such as the progressive marker on the predicate 'be.silent' in the example above. Let us also provide an example with a completive marker. Lexemes with gradual semantics marked by it acquire the meaning of reaching a limit as a result of a change in the specified feature over time:

(180) Nivkh
(Nedyalkov, Otaina 2011: 109)
a. Raq tuz-d'.
   porridge be.cold-IND
   'The porridge is cold.'
b. Raq tuz-γyt-t'.
   porridge be.cold-COMPL-IND.
   'The porridge is completely cold.'

The situation in Archi is similar to Nivkh, with the only difference being that most Archi verb forms are formed analytically. As stated in (Kibrik 1992a), Archi statives functioning as the head of a predication can form all semantically available verbal forms, cf. the imperfect I and II forms in the examples below:

(181) Archi
(Kibrik 1992a: 150)
a. Ch'e'p bi'k'w-shi ye-b-di-li lap.
   cradle be.heavy-CONV be.PST.EV very
   'The cradle was very heavy.'
b. K'ob chakh-mat yedi.
   clothes be.wet-CONTIN be.PST
   'The clothes continued to be wet.'

The use in attributive function for stative and other verbs is formed identically, with the participial marker `-t't'u`: `k'wat'i`- 'to be needed', `k'wat'it't'u boshor` 'needed man'; `akhas`- 'to lie down' `akhu-t't'ut` 'having lain down' (Ibid.: 151). It is noteworthy that "although, due to their semantics, statives clearly prefer participial formations from the constative (like `mu-t't'u-t`- 'beautiful'), their derivation from other temporal forms is nevertheless possible, for example, `mushi yedi-t't'ut` 'who was beautiful'" (Ibid.: 151).

Qualitative or stative verbs are usually divided into two actional classes. The first includes qualities, and the second, qualities that can also manifest as states changing over time. The second type of stative is defined as "characterizing" in (Kibrik 1992a) and as "qualitative-stative" and "qualitative-inceptive" in (Gruzdeva 2012).

The following table provides examples of stative lexemes and the grammatical categories of verbs with which they can be used; Archi material is presented according to (Kibrik 1992a), Nivkh according to (Panfilov 1976; Nedyalkov, Otaina 2011; Gruzdeva 2012):

As we can see, Russian adjectives correspond to many of the listed meanings of qualitative and qualitative-stative verbs.

Besides the overlap in lexical composition, statives in Archi and Nivkh demonstrate the following interesting property: in each of these languages, they are incompatible with forms of duration, the durative in Archi and the continuative in Nivkh. More precisely, in Nivkh, the continuative marking is ungrammatical specifically for qualitative statives, see (Gruzdeva 2012: 505). As for Archi, according to A. E. Kibrik, the stem of qualitative and characterizing statives coincides with the stem of the statives themselves: "Thus, the absence of corresponding aspectual forms in these predicates is not a lexical anomaly, but a consequence of their semantics. From this, the zero expression of the durative aspect becomes understandable: its material expression is redundant. Moreover, it can be argued that the stem of statives is inseparable from the aspectual meaning, i.e., statives do not have a pure non-aspectual stem" (Kibrik 1992a: 147). Thus, units with adjectival semantics exhibit incompatibility with certain aspect-tense forms (e.g., those denoting duration) even in languages where aspect and tense grammemes can combine with adjectival stems.

How do languages with statives relate to languages with adjectives? We will extend the analysis of statives adopted in (Kibrik 1992a) to languages with an adjectival category. In (Kibrik 1992a), a compositional approach to verb semantics is proposed. The action of verbs with the most developed argumental and actional structure is presented as consisting of several components: inception, reaching a limit, completion, result. Statives contain either only the final phase of the result ('to be big') or the result phase with a preceding process ('to be hot'). In stative languages, such meanings are combined into one category with meanings that also have a causation and process phase, i.e., with verbs.

We believe that languages with adjectives can be analyzed as those in which resulting states have formed a separate category. The label Adj, which adjectives receive in languages like Russian, contains features incompatible with the category V – thus, it is impossible to build the maximal projection of a verb over adjectives. In languages with statives, meanings like 'to be big' or 'to be hot' possess the categorical feature V and, as a consequence, can project a verbal structure. We will further develop the analysis of adjectives as resulting states, based, in particular, on the representation of event structure adopted in (Ramchand 2008). To anticipate a little, it can be said that the approach to adjectives as resulting states in languages like Russian allows us to explain the absence of accusative valency for adjectives; see the discussion of argument structure in Chapter 3. Accusative assignment is only a property of a verbal projection, therefore it is possible in languages with statives but not in languages with adjectives.

Next, we will discuss a typologically non-trivial case, represented by Russian adjectives. We will show that adjectives in Russian are capable of forming both nominal (FF) and verbal (SF) projections.

## 2.2.3. Full and Short Forms of Russian Adjectives in Predicative Function

## 2.2.3.1. Problem Statement

Let's begin the description of short and full forms of Russian adjectives with a quote: "By the grammatical category of attributiveness-non-attributiveness, we will henceforth refer to a grammatical category… which is externally expressed in the opposition of the so-called full and short forms of adjectives, for example, `tochnyy` and `tochen`, `uzkaya` and `uzka`, `surovyye` and `surovy`" (Zaliznyak 2002: 88). A. A. Zaliznyak's opinion is based on the syntactic functions of FFs and SFs: "The proposed name reflects the ability of full (attributive) word forms to appear in an attributive relation with nouns (e.g., `tochnyy pribor` 'precise device', `uzkaya doroga` 'narrow road', `surovyye lyudi` 'stern people') and the absence of such ability in short (non-attributive) word forms. The latter almost always appear in a phrase in a predicative function, for example: `eta doroga uzka` 'this road is narrow', `eti lyudi surov` 'these people are stern'" (Zaliznyak 2002: 88). The analysis we propose below largely inherits A. A. Zaliznyak's approach.

Questions usually raised when discussing short forms of Russian adjectives relate to their nature and functions and how they relate to full forms. Below, we will discuss the following problems: i) the order of morphological derivation of SFs (including comparatively with FF derivation); ii) the structure of predication with SFs; iii) the structure of predication with FFs.

## 2.2.3.2. Structure of SF and FF Word Forms

Morphologically, the endings of modern SFs are analogous to the nominative inflections of nominal declension and take the values of three genders in the singular and have one form for the plural: `bel-∅`, `bel-a`, `bel-o`, `bel-y` vs. `krot-∅`, `sten-a`, `oblak-o`, `krot-y`, see also (Babby 1985; Halle, Matushansky 2006). The question of the relationship between the word form structures in full and short forms is interesting. The grammatical features of SFs (gender, number) are a subset of those of FFs (gender, number, case). One could assume that FFs are "assembled" from SFs and some additional marker, for example, the case-responsible head `-oj` (Halle, Matushansky 2006) or another functional unit. Alternatively, one could consider that both forms are derived from some common stem. We will not consider the option where SFs are derived from FFs, as in this case, it would be necessary to explain how the phonologically and grammatically "fuller" FF becomes the "less full" SF.

Let us first consider the possibility of deriving FFs from SFs. A number of suffixes of Russian adjectives can indeed attach to other suffixes, cf. `plokh-ovat'-en'k-iy` 'bad-ish-dim-ish', `vred-n-yushch-iy` 'harm-suff-large-adj' etc. At the same time, deriving FFs from SFs does not seem possible, cf.:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Such a derivation could even be allowed, assuming that first the SF obtains gender and number features, then case, while the entire set of features {gender, number, case} is subjected to phonetic realization (which is natural for an inflective language):

(184) strash-n {gender, number}+{case} → strashnyy {gender, number, case};
slad-yk {gender, number}+{case} → sladkiy {gender, number, case}

However, we are unaware of facts supporting such a derivation order. On the contrary, the SF itself is characteristic only of a certain part of adjectives. This suggests that adjectives without an SF (and these are the majority) would not be able to express gender and number meanings if the latter were contained in the SF.

Thus, we will reject the hypothesis of FF formation from SF and consider the second option, according to which each form is formed in parallel from the same stem:

(185) Formation of SF and FF of Russian adjectives
star → star, stara, staro, stary
star → staryy, staraya, staroye, staryye, …

Next, we will discuss restrictions on SF derivation, then cases where the short and full forms have different semantics.

As A. A. Zaliznyak points out, "the traditional formula states that non-attributive word forms are derived from so-called qualitative adjectives and are not derived from so-called relational adjectives. However, in reality, almost any relational adjective can acquire a 'qualitative' nuance in the appropriate context (allowing, under otherwise favorable conditions, the formation of non-attributive word forms); therefore, the given formula proves ineffective. A much more real obstacle to the formation of non-attributive word forms is a specific morphological structure of the adjective. For example, regardless of meaning, adjectives whose attributive nominative plural form ends in `-y`, `-i` (cf. `moi` 'my', `dyadiny` 'uncle's', `volch'i` 'wolf's', `eti` 'these'), adjectives with the suffix `-sk`, etc., do not form non-attributive word forms" (Zaliznyak 2002: 90), see also (Yanko-Trinitskaya 1989: 50-51).

The semantic prohibition on SF formation is indeed easily overcome; see also (Pertsov 2015: 168-170) on the distinction between semantic and morphological ungrammaticality. In the following examples, the adjective does not refer to a certain object (`zemlya` 'earth', `provintsiya` 'province', `beton` 'concrete', `komanda` 'team'), but essentially defines a new quality, somehow related to this object, and the formation of an SF becomes possible:

(186) (Internet)
Kak ona skudna, Kak ona zemna!
'How poor she is, how earthly she is!'
Abramovich prost, primitiven, provintsialen.
'Abramovich is simple, primitive, provincial.'
{… tam okopalsya Lenin.} On nadoel, on star i betonen.
'{… Lenin entrenched himself there.} He got tiresome, he is old and concrete-like.'
My skoree anarkhichny, chem komandny…
'We are rather anarchic than team-like…'

Regarding the morphological prohibition on SF formation, it is associated with the use of a number of adjectivizing suffixes, such as `-sk`, `-shn`, `-vsh`, `-ev`, etc. That the cause of ungrammaticality is morphology, not phonology, can be shown by the following examples:

¹⁸ `Grud' obita, ploska, sloista` (I. A. Bunin). 'The chest is beaten, flat, layered.'

²⁰ `… a spisok dlinnyushch, nado priznat'sya…` (Internet). '... and the list is extremely long, I must admit...'
²¹ `Tarzanka laskov byl, khitryushch, uporno dobivalsya svoyego…` (Internet). 'Tarzan was affectionate, cunning, persistently sought his own...'

As the examples in the table show, the formation of SFs from nominal, adverbial, and verbal stems marked with certain suffixes is difficult. That recategorizing morphology is in principle capable of providing adjectives with the possibility of SF formation can be shown by numerous denominal and deverbative derivatives such as `sluchayen` 'accidental', `pechalen` 'sad', …; `staratelen` 'diligent', `s'yedoben` 'edible', etc. The possibility of forming SFs from stems ending in `-sh` and `-shch` is not easy to demonstrate, as there are almost no non-derived adjectives with such endings, with the exception of `khorosh` 'good' (`prigozh` 'handsome') and formations with the suffix `-ushch` / `-yushch`. The grammaticality of SFs from derivatives with `-ushch` / `-yushch` (`dlinnyushch` 'extremely long'), however, also strikingly contrasts with the ungrammaticality of participial adjectives (`*podkhodyashch` 'suitable', …). The contrast between evaluative adjectival suffixes `-ushch` / `-yushch`, on the one hand, and participial `-(a/ya)shch`, `-(u/yu)shch` (as well as participial `-vsh`, `-l`) - on the other, suggests that the prohibition is specifically related to the type of suffix. A separate interesting case is the two variants of the suffix `-n`, one of which allows SFs and the other does not, cf.: `zhaloben` 'pitiful', `gramoten` 'literate', `kaprizen` 'capricious' vs. `*sta-len`, `*dalen`, `*sploshen`…

As we can see, the same stem ending can yield different results when forming SFs. SF formation is practically blocked by a number of suffixes. Conversely, SFs are possessed either by (synchronically) non-derived adjectives: `cheren` 'black', `vesel` 'cheerful', `zhiv` 'alive', `vysok` 'tall', …, or by adjectives with suffixes of a certain type (`-n`, `-ist`, `-liv`, `-at`, …): `silen` 'strong', `normalen` 'normal', `golosist` 'melodious', `suyetliv` 'fussy', `volosat` 'hairy'…

So, in Russian, we have two large classes of adjectives: with SFs (such adjectives, if semantics allow, can also form morphological comparatives, be intensified, etc.) and without.

Furthermore, a number of adjectives in FF and SF have different meanings, cf., for example:

(188)

| Full Form (FF)                        | Short Form (SF)                                   |

| `tyomnoye delo` / `tyomnaya istoriya` | `*Delo bylo temno` / `*Istoriya byla temna`.     |
| 'dark matter' / 'dark story'          | '*The matter was dark' / '*The story was dark.'  |
| `lyogkiye den'gi` / `lyogkiy zarabotok` | `*Den'gi byli legki` / `*Zarabotok byl lyogok`.  |
| 'easy money' / 'easy earning'         | '*The money was easy' / '*The earning was easy.' |
| `nizkaya strast'`                     | `*Strast' byla nizka`.                            |
| 'low passion'                         | '*The passion was low.'                           |
| `glubokaya noch'` / `osen'`          | `*Osen'` / `noch' byla gluboka`.                 |
| 'deep night' / 'autumn'               | '*The autumn' / 'night was deep.'                |
| `molodoye pokoleniye` / `molodaya sem'ya` | `*Pokoleniye bylo molodo` / `*Sem'ya byla moloda`. |
| 'young generation' / 'young family'   | '*The generation was young' / '*The family was young.' |
| `uverennaya pobeda`                   | `*Pobeda byla uverena`.                           |
| 'confident victory'                   | '*The victory was confident.'                     |
| `grubaya tkan'`                       | `*Tkan' byla gruba`.                              |
| 'rough fabric'                        | '*The fabric was rough.'                          |

As we can see, metaphorical uses are available for a number of FFs, which may be absent in SFs.

To summarize: i) a significant portion of adjectives can form only FFs and do not have SFs; ii) in a large number of cases, the meaning of FFs and SFs may not coincide. If we assumed that FFs are formed from SFs, explaining the near-absolute productivity of FFs, as well as the greater semantic restriction of SFs, would be difficult.

Thus, for those adjectives that have both SFs and FFs, both forms are derived in parallel from the same stem. Adjectives that have only FFs form them from some stem, while SF formation for such adjectives is impossible for some reason:

(189) Formation of SF and FF of Russian adjectives
a. Adjectives with SFs and FFs
   star → star, stara, staro, stary
   star → staryy, staraya, staroye, staryye, …
b. Adjectives with FFs only
   russk → russkiy, russkaya, russkoye, russkiye, …

What is the nature of the morphological prohibition on SF formation? As we have seen, SFs are impermissible for adjectives formed with certain suffixes. We assume that the impossibility of forming certain forms (both in morphology and in syntax) is related to the incompatibility between certain grammatical features. For example, in the domain of verbal morphology, there is a prohibition on the formation of participles ending in `-(a/ya)shch`, `-(u/yu)shch` from prefixed stems like `priplyt'` 'to swim to': `*priplyvushchiy` 'swimming to', etc. This is prevented by the incompatibility of the perfective aspect feature, present in the prefix `pri-`, and the present tense feature, contained in the participle ending in `-shch`.

In connection with the prohibition on SF formation, the parallel between adjectives and participles is interesting. The syntactic side of the analogy "SF of passive participles / adjectives - FF of participles / adjectives" was developed by L. Babby in his time, see (Babby 1975; Babby 1985). The morphological side of the analogy is that, as with adjectives, SFs are permissible only for some participles. More precisely, SFs can only be formed from passive, but not from active participles: `*vzvolnovavsh` (active past part.), `vzvolnovan` (passive past part. SF); `*volnuyushch` (active present part.), `*volnovavsh` (active past part.), `volnuyem` (passive present part. SF).

Recall that the result of our discussion on the structure of the adjectival word form in Russian was the following structure for FFs:

(190) Structure of FF adjectives in Russian
<!-- image -->

We have identified two subclasses of adjectives, Adj and Atr, the first of which is capable of forming SFs (and other forms), and the second is not. The question arises: why are passive participles and adjectivals (adjectives with the Adj feature) contrasted, on the one hand, and active participles and attributives (adjectives with the Atr feature) - on the other?

We believe that passive participles and adjectivals are united by the fact that they denote a certain state in which the described object is located – cf. languages with stative adjectives. The SFs of Russian and, as we will show, the complex predicates of Ossetian demonstrate that "true" adjectives are analogous to verbs in their ability to define a certain fragment of a situation and introduce its participants. The difference between adjectives and verbs lies in the fact that they can only define states, while verbs also contain components responsible for the inception and development of an event. We will consider that the heads of Russian adjective SFs are responsible for gender and case and are built upon the `res` head, which is responsible for the final state acquired by the object of a transitive verb, cf. `Dom postroyen` 'The house is built,' etc.

The unavailability of SFs for active participles and attributives is explained by the same reason. Active participles contain `proc` and/or `caus` projections, responsible for the inception and development of an event (see below the discussion of Ossetian complex predicates and the literature cited there). Active participles are thus located higher in the lexical structure of the verb and cannot become the complement of the `res` head. Attributives also cannot be the complement of `res`, as the `res` head in all languages takes only complements of category Adj (not Atr). Units of category Adj, unlike attributives, are capable of having their own participants and forming part of the subevent defined by the verb; see in this regard also the analysis of the resultative use of adjectives in (Baker 2003).

The structure of the word form with SF is analogous to the organization of the word form with FF. In the case of SF, the features of the `adjK` head – unlike the features of the `adjP` head – do not contain case, and instead of the A head, responsible for attributive usage, the `res` head is present (see (191)).

In the following discussion, an approach to (Russian) adjectivals as containing argumental and event structure will be developed.

## 2.2.3.3. FF and SF in Predicative Function
<!-- image -->

The first works that thoroughly investigated the differences in the behavior of Russian adjectives in attributive and predicative positions date back to the 1960s. A. V. Isachenko (Isachenko 1963) was one of the first to raise the problem of distinguishing between attributive and predicative adjective usage, and the related problem of the status of FFs and SFs in Russian. Noting the difficulty of verifying claims such as greater or lesser temporal correlation, and setting the task of finding syntactic rather than semantic justification for certain properties of adjectives, Isachenko concludes that full forms are obtained as a result of the transformation of structures with short forms: "...we consider the form `zdorovyy` in the schema `Etot zdorovyy mal'chik` 'This healthy boy' and the form `zdorov` in the schema `Etot mal'chik zdorov` 'This boy is healthy' as forms of adjectives. Both forms are equivalent to each other; one is a transform of the other" (Ibid.: 80). The existence of "redundant" predicative FFs is explained by Isachenko as follows: nominal predications like `Etot mal'chik zdorovyy` 'This boy is healthy' are reduced to successive transformations of the structures `Etot mal'chik zdorov` 'This boy is healthy (SF)' and `Mal'chik COP`²² `mal'chik` 'Boy is boy'. Isachenko sees the difference between the sentences `Kitayskiy yazyk ochen' truden` 'The Chinese language is very difficult (SF)' and `Kitayskiy yazyk ochen' trudnyy` 'The Chinese language is very difficult (FF)' in that the full form of the adjective always corresponds to a "nominal" usage. Thus, `Kitayskiy yazyk ochen' trudnyy` 'The Chinese language is very difficult (FF)' effectively goes back to the structure `Kitayskiy yazyk ochen' trudnyy (yazyk)` 'The Chinese language is a very difficult (language)', see (Isachenko 1963: 80-85).

The distribution of FFs and SFs of adjectives is asymmetric: FFs can appear in both attributive and predicative positions, while SFs can only be used predicatively:

(192)
(Isachenko 1963: 83)
a. zdorovyy mal'chik
   'healthy boy'
c. *zdorov mal'chik
   '*healthy boy (SF)'
b. Mal'chik (byl) zdorovyy.
   'The boy (was) healthy (FF).'
d. Mal'chik (byl) zdorov.
   'The boy (was) healthy (SF).'

The only syntactic context available for adjective SFs is primary predication²³. At the same time, adjective FFs, at least at first glance, are not limited to attributive contexts but can also be predicative. Research into the problem of predicative adjectives has largely focused on explaining the asymmetry in the distribution of short and full forms. The fact that SFs lack attributive usage suggests that such asymmetry is nothing more than a superficial expression of a deep symmetry. According to this analysis, adjective FFs in Russian are always attributive and in predicative usage are associated with the presence of a nominal projection²⁴. First proposed in (Isachenko 1963) and developed in (Babby 1973; Siegel 1976; Babby 1994) and other works, such an approach to predicative FFs has become generally accepted in formal Russian studies. In the mentioned works by Babby, Siegel, and Bailyn, as in some others, adjective FFs in predicative usage are considered attributive adjectives with an unrealized nominal head.

²² Copula.
²³ It seems that the only exception to this observation in modern Russian is the context of secondary predication with the verbs `stat'` 'to become', `sdelat'sya` 'to become', `okazat'sya` 'to turn out to be' (`stal/sdelalsya/okazalsya zdorov` 'became/turned out to be healthy (SF)').
²⁴ Siegel writes: "We can now say that long forms are actually generated only prenominally and short forms only in predicate position" (Siegel 1976).

One of the arguments in favor of this analysis, see (Siegel 1976; Matushansky 2006b; Bailyn 2012) and others, is related to the difference in interpretation of the following pairs of sentences:

(193)
(Siegel 1976: 297)
a. Studentka umna. SF, absolute interpretation
   'The student (FEM) is smart (SF).'
b. Studentka umnaya. FF, relative interpretation
   'The student (FEM) is smart (FF).'

The "relative" interpretation observed in (b) arises in this approach due to the presence of a free variable Δ ('Studentka umnaya Δ'), whose domain of variation is the set of common nouns. Such a free variable can correspond to a zero head and be bound by the subject.

However, the assertion about the attributive nature of adjective FFs in predicative position is not shared by all. In (Pereltsvaig 2007), nominative FFs are contrasted with SFs and instrumental FFs. The former, according to Pereltsvaig, are part of predicative DPs, while the latter are adjective projections. Let's list some counterarguments against the attributive analysis.

One of the most well-known arguments for the attributive analysis is agreement in number:

(194)
a. Vy krasivy / *krasiva.
   'You (PL) are beautiful (PL) / *beautiful (FEM SG).'
b. Vy krasivaya / *krasivyye.
   'You (SG FEM) are beautiful (SG FEM) / *beautiful (PL).'
c. Vy prishli / *prishla.
   'You (PL) came (PL) / *came (SG FEM).'

In the case of a single referent for the polite form of the pronoun `Vy`, the SF requires plural agreement—like the verb—while the FF requires singular agreement. This fact, on the one hand, allows us to say that SFs are grouped with verbal forms, see (Babby 1975; Geist 2010), and on the other hand, provides grounds to assume that a zero nominal head stands behind the FF.

The latter claim is questioned in (Geist 2010; Borik 2014). For example, in (Geist 2010), it is argued that reconstructing a phonologically unexpressed head is syntactically impossible – it is unclear which specific noun stands behind it:

(195)
(Geist 2010: 246)
Posle ekzamena Ivan byl ustalyy. (ustalyy: chelovek? / student? / Ivan?)
'After the exam Ivan was tired (FF). (tired: person? / student? / Ivan?)'

Another argument is the underspecification of the predicative FF in terms of gender (Geist 2010: 246) and number (Borik 2014: 146). The gender and number values of predicative FFs always replicate those of the noun and do not correspond to the value of the corresponding feature in a possible unexpressed head:

(196)
(Geist 2010: 246)
a. Sergey khoroshaya nyanya.
   'Sergey is a good nanny (FEM).'
b. *Sergey khoroshaya.
   '*Sergey is good (FEM).'
(197)
(Borik 2014: 146)
a. Ovoschi byli poleznym produktom.
   'Vegetables were a useful (INSTR SG) product.'
b. *Ovoschi byli poleznym.
   '*Vegetables were useful (INSTR SG).'

Instead, (Geist 2010; Borik 2014) propose that adjectives in predicative position are used not as part of a noun phrase with a null element, but in isolation.

To the aforementioned criticism of the attributive analysis of predicative FFs, the following three arguments can be added. Firstly, adjective FFs in predicative position do not retain the idiomatic interpretation observed in attributive position:

(198)
(Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007)
a. zolotaya rybka (vneshniy priznak vs. personazh skazki)
   'goldfish' (external feature vs. fairy tale character)
b. Rybka (byla) zolotaya. (tol'ko pro tsvet)
   'The fish (was) golden (FF).' (only about color)
(199)
(Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007)
a. mednyye truby (bibleyskaya metafora vs. material)
   'brass pipes' (biblical metaphor vs. material)
b. Truby (byli) mednyye. (tol'ko v znachenii materiala)
   'The pipes (were) copper (FF).' (only in the meaning of material)
(200)
(Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007)
a. kitayskaya gramota ('nechto slozhnoye i neponyatnoye' vs. natsional'nost')
   'Chinese writing' ('something complex and incomprehensible' vs. nationality)
b. Gramota (byla) kitayskaya. (tol'ko v znachenii prilagatel'nogo natsional'nosti)
   'The writing (was) Chinese (FF).' (only in the meaning of the adjective of nationality)

It seems that the situation in many other languages is analogous, cf. English: `hot dogs` ('sausages') vs. `*The dogs were hot`; `a golden parachute` ('large severance pay upon dismissal') vs. `*His parachute was golden`, etc.

Secondly, facts related to the formation of an adjective "chain" demonstrate another contrast between predicative and attributive adjective FFs. The predicative position, unlike the attributive, is impossible with neutral intonation in the case of two or more adjectives:

(201)
a. shirokoye sineye more
   'wide blue sea'
b. *More (bylo) shirokoye sineye.
   '*The sea (was) wide blue (FF).'
(202)
a. vysokiy kamennyy dom
   'tall stone house'
b. *Dom (byl) vysokiy kamennyy.
   '*The house (was) tall stone (FF).'

According to (Baker 2003: 203), the prohibition on two or more unsyndicated predicative adjectives is quite universal:

(203) English
(Baker 2003: 203)
a. John is a big strong man.
b. *John is big strong.
   Intended: 'John is big and strong.'
(204) Edo
(Baker 2003: 203)
a. ágá khéré pè rhè
   armchair small flat
   'small flat armchair'
b. *Né!né ágá yé khéré pè rhè.
   DEF armchair COP small flat
   Intended: 'This armchair is small and flat.'

Thirdly, one variant of the attributive approach to predicative FFs could be an analysis involving the movement of the entire noun phrase, apart from the adjective, into the subject position, (simplified) presented below:

(205)
a. Dom byl kamennyy.
   'The house was stone (made of stone).'
b. [vP byl [DP kamennyy dom]]
c. [TP domi [vP byl [DP kamennyy ti]]]

Indeed, in Russian, there are constructions with predicative FFs that clearly derive from predicative noun phrases. Predicative nominal heads in such constructions have a classifying meaning and move into the topic position:

(206)
(Internet)
a. Uchitel'nitsa ona byla strogaya.
   'A teacher, she was strict (FF).'
b. Chelovek on byl dobryy.
   'A person, he was kind (FF).'
c. Zhenschina ona byla zlaya.
   'A woman, she was evil (FF).'

It is noteworthy that substituting FFs with SFs in such cases is impossible, which indeed suggests the original attributive position of FFs:

(207)
a. *Uchitel'nitsa ona byla stroga.
   '*A teacher, she was strict (SF).'
b. *Chelovek on byl dobr.
   '*A person, he was kind (SF).'
c. *Zhenschina ona byla zla.
   '*A woman, she was evil (SF).'

However, derivation with the movement/deletion of the head noun is impossible in cases where the subject of the nominal predication is a proper noun or a pronoun. Both of these represent DP-level units, and adjectives (regardless of their role in the noun phrase) are generated within the DP. At the same time, nominal predications like `Petya / On byl veselyy` 'Petya / He was cheerful' behave analogously to predications like `Dom byl kamennyy` 'The house was stone'.

Below, we will formulate our approach to the structure of Russian predicative FFs, based on our conclusions about word form structure and the functions of SFs and FFs. The analysis of predicative FFs will be preceded by a brief description of the structure of nominal predication and an examination of the syntax of predicative SFs.

## 2.2.3.4. Approaches to the Structure of Nominal Predication

In (Bowers 1993), the existence of an abstract head Pred in nominal predications was justified, responsible for assigning a semantic role to the subject. Predicative noun phrases or adjective phrases are selected as complements by the Pred head, which, according to Bowers, is also responsible in Russian for assigning the predicative instrumental case. Such an analysis has become quite widespread, see (Bailyn 2001; 2002; 2012; Strigin, Demjjanow 2001) and other works.

The problems faced by researchers when analyzing nominal predication in Russian can be briefly summarized as follows. Firstly, it is necessary to explain the process of case agreement. In the case of nominal or secondary predication, as well as in separated usages, agreement can be with a nominative subject, an accusative object, and sometimes with some other participants. Secondly, it is necessary to explain the predicative instrumental case in both nominal (`Mal'chik byl bol'nym` 'The boy was sick (INSTR)') and secondary (`Ya prosnulsya bol'nym` 'I woke up sick (INSTR)') predication.

The hypothesis about the existence of Pred helps solve the problem of instrumental assignment. Indeed, while the source of the copula-bound instrumental might somehow be localized (specifically within the existential copula), the instrumental in secondary predication appears to "emerge from thin air." Since each value of a case feature must have its own source, it was necessary to localize it also in the case of the predicative instrumental.

Different researchers have developed different conceptions of how the Pred head is realized. In (Strigin, Demjjanow 2001), it was proposed that the nominative as an agreement case on the adjective arises due to a mechanism of "percolation" of case from Pred. Strigin and Demjjanow hypothesize the existence of two Pred heads: one with nominal φ-features and one without. The difference in the marking of nominal predicates (agreement vs. instrumental) is linked to the type of Pred head used.

In (Bailyn 2001; 2002; 2012), a structural distinction is drawn between the instrumental, the agreeing case of secondary predication, and the nominative of nominal predication. The instrumental always has Pred as its source, in both primary and secondary predication. The "repeated" case of secondary predication ("sameness case" in Bailyn's terminology) is a result of multiple agreement. In this case, a single source of the case feature serves both the argumental noun phrase and the secondary predicate, which is an adjunct. Finally, the case of agreeing nominal predication is analyzed as a result of the action of "overt predicators." The structures formed thereby, as in the case of the instrumental, are linked to PredP, but the head position is filled not by a null functional head, but by various forms of the verb `byt'` 'to be', which are the source of the nominative feature. Nominal predication with the instrumental is formed analogously to secondary predication with the instrumental.

In addition, a number of approaches have been proposed related to distinguishing between individual-level and stage-level interpretations, temporal correlation of main and secondary predication events, etc., see (Filip 2001; Richardson 2001; 2007: 107-163; Markman 2008; Matushansky 2008b) and others.

A different structure is usually proposed for Russian adjective SFs. Starting with (Babby 1973), many researchers have adopted an approach to SFs as units having a verbal nature. For example, in (Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007; Geist 2010; Borik 2014), it is proposed that short and full forms of adjectives organize nominal predication differently. Short forms behave like verbs, using the T head "directly," while full forms require "support" – participation of an abstract Pred head in their derivation.

An important argument in favor of the absence of PredP in predications with the short form is the fact that the SF can independently assign a semantic role. In (Geist 2010), the following paradigm is given:

(208)
(Geist 2010: 249-250)
a. Rebenok bol'noy.
   'The child is sick (FF).'
d. Golos u nego bol'noy.
   'He has a sick voice (FF).'
b. Rebenok bolen.
   'The child is sick (SF).'
e. *Golos u nego bolen.
   '*He has a sick voice (SF).'
c. Rebenok boleyet.
   'The child is sick (verb).'
f. *Golos u nego boleyet.
   '*He has a sick voice (verb).'

The semantic restrictions on the subject in this case coincide for the SF and the verb, while for the adjective FF, a metonymic transformation 'possessor' - 'possessed' is permissible. This fact may suggest that the mechanism of semantic role assignment exists for the SF and the verb, while the FF is not capable of independently assigning a semantic role.

Following (Bailyn 2012) to a certain extent, we will analyze predicative FFs as being formed with the participation of the Pred head. This approach applies to both the "agreement" (in the case of nominal predication, nominative) strategy and the instrumental strategy. The difference lies only in the specific mechanisms that dictate the choice of agreement or predicative instrumental. As we will show, SFs, unlike FFs, do not require a Pred head and, similar to participles, are complements of the functional projection T.

## 2.2.3.5. Predicative SF

Let's consider the following examples:

(209)
(Internet)
Byt' zdorovym - dolg pered buduschimi det'mi.
'To be healthy (INSTR) is a duty to future children.'
Byt' vezhlivym - znachit umet' sebya vesti i imet' khoroshiye manery.
'To be polite (INSTR) means to know how to behave and have good manners.'

The subjects in the main clauses here are infinitives, forming a nominal predication. The nominal part of such a predication is represented by the instrumental case — one of the possible ways to mark the nominal part in Russian. If we try to change the form of the predicate, however, we find that neither the agreement / nominative strategy with FFs nor SFs are grammatical:

(210)
*Byt' zdorovyy / zdorov - dolg pered buduschimi det'mi.
'*To be healthy (FF) / healthy (SF) is a duty to future children.'
*Byt' vezhlivyy / vezhliv - znachit umet' sebya vesti i imet' khoroshiye manery.
'*To be polite (FF) / polite (SF) means to know how to behave and have good manners.'

The reason for ungrammaticality, in our opinion, in both cases is that both the nominative FF and the SF require a local subject. From the fact that in the case of the instrumental FF it is not required, we can conclude that in the case of the nominative FF, the ungrammaticality is related to case. Gender and number features are present in both types of FFs and obviously do not lead to ungrammaticality of the instrumental FF. As we will show below, the realization of the case feature is critical in the formation of predicative FFs in the nominative.

The situation with the SF seems different – it has no case, yet its participation in an infinitive clause without a subject is equally ungrammatical. The difference between SF and FF, it seems, indicates that the subject in the case of each form is generated in different positions. The presence of a subject is more critical for the SF, which can receive gender and number features only from it. Instrumental FFs can change gender and number values depending on pragmatics. Thus, gender and number in the following examples can be changed without loss of grammaticality:

(211)
(Internet)
Eto yestestvennoye zhelaniye - byt' krasivoy.
'It is a natural desire to be beautiful (FEM SG).'
Blagodarim vsekh za stremleniye byt' uspeshnymi!
'We thank everyone for the desire to be successful (PL)!'

(212)
Eto yestestvennoye zhelaniye - byt' krasivym (i).
'It is a natural desire to be beautiful (MASC SG / NEUT SG).'
Blagodarim za stremleniye byt' uspeshnym!
'We thank for the desire to be successful (MASC SG / NEUT SG)!'

Thus, the grammaticality of predication derivation with FFs depends on the possibility for the subject to transmit a case feature (nominative) to the adjective FF. For predication with SFs, the presence of a subject is necessary for the realization of both gender and number features, which occurs as a result of agreement with the subject.

Note that SFs are perfectly acceptable in infinitives of raising:

(213)
(Internet)
Ona khotela byt' krasiva.
'She wanted to be beautiful (SF).'
Ty mozhesh' byt' uspeshen vo vremya krizisa.
'You can be successful (SF) during a crisis.'

The facts presented suggest the necessity of a subject at the earliest stages of deriving predications with SFs.

The question of the existence of a specifier in the adjective phrase corresponding to the subject participant is a key one for us. We believe that the analysis of Russian language material allows for a positive answer to this question. However, the specifier position is not available to all units belonging to the adjective category. Only adjectivals, but not attributives, have their own subject, as well as argument and event structure, in Russian. One of the properties of Russian adjectivals is the ability to form SFs, so the specifier position in SFs is always available. It can be said that Russian adjective SFs thus approximate stative verbs – in the spirit of (Babby 1973; Geist 2010; Borik 2014) and others.

So, Russian SFs, like verbs, can project their own arguments. Analogous to the lexical verbal head V, the adjectival head Adj is responsible for the subject's projection. Other dependents, as is generally accepted, are determined by the lexical core of the adjective and are generated in the complement position:

(221)
<!-- image -->

An important feature of SF syntax is that, unlike FFs, they form a simple predication without the participation of the predicative head Pred. Recall that Pred is necessary for two reasons: i) assigning a semantic role and ii) (in languages like Russian) assigning a case feature. In the case of predication with SFs, the first task is performed by the Adj head, and SFs lack case features; consequently, the need for using Pred disappears. Note that adjectives in this case approximate short participles, which, obviously, also form a simple predication without the participation of Pred.

Regardless of the presence of their own lexical complements, short adjectives are always used as complements of the TP projection — in this, they resemble verbs:

(222) Structure of predication with SF
<!-- image -->

The subject, generated in the specifier position of the Adj projection, raises through the specifier of the result phrase into Spec, TP. The adjective head also moves up the structure, first into the position of the `res` head, then into `adjK`, where it receives gender ({M}) and number ({SG}) features.

Without going into detail, let's say that the gender and number features of SFs are most likely realized within the adjectival projection. This mechanism of agreement is supported by the previously demonstrated dependence of SFs on the presence of their own subject at early stages of derivation (`Ona khotela byt' krasiva` 'She wanted to be beautiful (SF)' vs. `*Byt' krasiva - yeyo zhelaniye` '*To be beautiful (SF) is her desire'). The absence of a case feature in SFs, which would also be realized in Spec, TP and would require expression on the SF, argues against agreement after the subject moves to Spec, TP. One can assume that the agreement of SFs with the subject in gender and number occurs in the configuration [adjK adjK [resP [DP] res]], i.e., when the adjK head takes the res phrase as its complement, in whose specifier the moved subject is located. We will leave a detailed analysis of agreement mechanisms for the future.

Thus, we believe that adjectives, like verbs, can project their own arguments. Moreover, the rules for argument projection are the same for adjectives and verbs – the internal argument is related to the projection of the lexical head. The main difference between adjectives and verbs is the inability of adjective SFs to head a finite clause and express aspect-tense meanings in the absence of the verb `byt'` 'to be'.

## 2.2.3.6. Predicative FF

Below, we will discuss the formation of nominal predication with FFs. We will start by examining the differences in the internal structure of SFs and FFs, and then discuss the question of the functional structure of nominal predications with the full form.

The derivation of SFs and FFs of adjectives in predicative use differs. As we will show, SFs can form expanded constituents within which the Adj projection and its associated subject and other participants are available. At the same time, the predicative FF cannot have an internal structure and is always formed as a projection of the Atr category. Predications with FFs, we believe, differ from predications with SFs in two parameters: i) FFs are "selected" in the derivation process by the Pred head, which is responsible for projecting the subject and assigning it a semantic role; ii) predicative FFs are formed as "flat" constituents, lacking internal structure, and cannot assign a semantic role. We will propose an explanation for the latter statement at the very end of the analysis of predicative FFs.

Such an approach explains the difference in interpretation between the sentences `Mal'chik (byl) zdorov` 'The boy (was) healthy (SF)' and `Mal'chik (byl) zdorovyy` 'The boy (was) healthy (FF)'. In the case of SF, we are dealing with a situation defined by a stative predicate and actual over a certain temporal distance. In the case of FF, a classifying meaning is presented, the same as in attributive usage ('the boy is among the healthy ones').

Let's consider the arguments proposed in (Geist 2010) and (Borik 2014). As L. Geist noted, SFs are more selective in subject choice. In the absence of complements, the predicative FF behaves in this regard analogously to the attributive FF, both of them being contrasted with the SF. At the same time, according to O. Borik, attributive FFs with complements are grouped with SFs:

(223)
a. Mal'chik / Golos byl bol'noy.
   'The boy / voice was sick (FF).'
b. bol'noy golos / mal'chik
   'sick voice / boy'
c. Mal'chik / *Golos byl bolen.
   'The boy / *voice was sick (SF).'
d. bol'noy anginoy mal'chik / *golos
   'boy sick with angina / *voice'

As we can see, predicative and attributive FFs without complements, on the one hand, are contrasted with SFs and attributive FFs with complements, on the other. As we will show, this is due to the fact that only SFs and attributive FFs (but not predicative FFs) can have an Adj projection.

As we proposed above, the FF is formed with the participation of `adjP`, containing features of gender, number, and case, and built over the functional head A, responsible for attributive usage. We also hypothesized that the lexical core of the FF projection can be of category Adj or Atr:

(224) Structure of FF adjectives in Russian
<!-- image -->

The SF is formed with the participation of the `adjK` head, which has gender and number features and is built over the functional `res` head. The SF can only be formed from Adj, but not from Atr:

(225) Structure of SF adjectives in Russian
<!-- image -->

It is important that the attributive use of FFs allows for the use of the Adj projection, while the predicative use does not. This helps explain why attributive FFs with complements behave like SFs, cf.: `*bol'noy anginoy golos` '*voice sick with angina' / `*Golos bolen anginoy` '*The voice is sick with angina'. The reason for ungrammaticality in both cases is that the Adj head assigns a semantic role, and the noun phrase `golos` 'voice' cannot be a participant in the 'to be sick' situation. In the case of FFs without a complement, no semantic role is assigned, and the linking of the situation and its participants occurs on the basis of pragmatics, which allows for a broader interpretation of relations, cf. the grammaticality of `bol'noy mal'chik / golos` 'sick boy / voice'; `Mal'chik / golos byl bol'noy` 'The boy / voice was sick (FF)' (cf. also the previously given examples of contrast between the meaning of SF and FF).

An important consequence here is that structures with predicative FFs demonstrate an attributive nature, i.e., they are formed with the participation of the Atr category, not Adj. Let's elaborate on this.

Our criticism of the attributive analysis presented above indicates that the predicative use of FFs is not related to ellipsis of the nominal head. At the same time, we adhere to an attributive approach to predicative FFs in the sense that specified attributive word forms, containing `adjP` and `A` heads, are used in the function of a nominal predicate.

So, predicative FFs in Russian are APs, not DPs, but such APs in Russian are specific precisely to attributive usage. Generalizing somewhat, it can be said that the situation may be analogous in other languages as well. In languages like English, predicative adjectives also represent APs, which can explain the universality of de-idiomatization and the prohibition on two or more adjectives. The only difference between Russian and English is the latter's lack of forms specialized in a predicative function.

Unlike SFs, adjective FFs have a case feature. For this reason, Russian FFs within a nominal predicate are always formed with the participation of the Pred head, which takes projections with a case feature as its complement.

Subjects of nominal predications with FFs, therefore, are generated in Spec, PredP. For the construction of the nominal part of a predication with an FF, the realization of gender, number, and case features on the adjective is necessary. Moving higher up the structure into Spec, TP, subjects receive the nominative value. After this, gender, number, and case features percolate down the structure to the nominal part of the predication. The adjective FF, thus, receives all necessary features only after the subject noun phrase raises to the subject position:

(226)
<!-- image -->

Such a mechanism has several consequences, one of which we will discuss a little later. Another is that the formation of the subject DP is independent of the predicative AP (`adjP`), which explains the impossibility of mismatching the subject and (part of) the predicate in gender or number (`*Sergey khoroshaya {nyanya}` '*Sergey is a good {nanny}'; `*Ovoschi byli poleznym {produktom}` '*Vegetables were a useful {product}').

Another consequence of the proposed analysis is that it is not subject to the criticism previously leveled against earlier variants of the attributive approach.

De-idiomatization automatically follows from our proposed structure: the parts of the noun phrases `zolotaya rybka` 'goldfish', `mednyye truby` 'brass pipes', `kitayskaya gramota` 'Chinese writing' no longer form a single element, but effectively represent two different constituents. For idioms that are stored in the lexicon as a single lexical unit, this is unacceptable.

The problem of the prohibition of two or more attributive adjectives (`*More bylo shirokoye sineye` '*The sea was wide blue (FF)', etc.) is also solved just as automatically. Since the adjective phrase is part of the nominal predicate, the "layering" of several adjectives is impossible — this is only permissible within a noun phrase.

The problem of the quantity of nominal structure brought into subject position (DP vs. NP; `Petya byl veselyy` 'Petya was cheerful (FF)' vs. `chelovek byl veselyy` 'the person was cheerful (FF)') also does not arise: the subject noun phrase and the adjective projection are formed independently.

Let us turn, finally, to the question of why predicative FFs are available only for the Atr category, but not for the Adj category. Suppose that a predicative FF is formed with the participation of Adj category units. The ungrammaticality of such a derivation would have two immediate reasons: i) a "delay" in the realization of adjective agreement features and ii) duplication of semantic roles of Adj and Pred projections. Let's analyze the situation in more detail.

As we established earlier, Adj category adjectives have an internal structure; in particular, they project their own subject (see (227)).

(227)
<!-- image -->

In such a structure, the realization of agreement features on the adjective would only be complete when the subject noun phrase raises to Spec, TP and receives the (nominative) value of the case feature. For this, the subject needs to successively raise to Spec, PredP and then to Spec, TP. If, however, one adheres to the hypothesis that PredP, like vP, is a phase, i.e., must contain only realized features, we would get a situation where the subject has not yet managed to raise to Spec, TP to receive the nominative feature, but the features on the predicative FF must already receive a concrete realization. Such a conflict does not arise in the case of attributive FFs, as the subject in this case is generated higher, in Spec, PredP. Predications with SFs are also not associated with such a conflict, as they do not have PredP. This is the first problem of predicative FFs with Adj status.

The second problem is related to semantic roles: both Spec, AdjP, and Spec, PredP provide the subject noun phrase with a semantic role. What proves problematic here is not even the multiplicity of semantic roles, cf. the (almost) universally accepted approach to the formation of relative clauses, as a result of which the head has two semantic roles: one from the embedded and one from the matrix predication. What may be problematic is that the roles assigned by PredP and AdjP are to some extent identical: both heads define a certain state, quality, etc.

Thus, we have provided two arguments according to which nominal predications with FFs cannot be formed with the participation of the "full" adjective structure projected by the Adj head. Below, when discussing argument structure in section 3.1.5, we will provide additional evidence for the ungrammaticality of predicative FFs with internal structure. Predicative FFs of any adjectives, therefore, are formed as a projection of the Atr category.

## 2.2.4. Summary: Adjectives as Nominal and Stative Predicates

We began by considering which of the two uses of adjectives, predicative or attributive, could be considered basic. We concluded that both functions are equally important and typical for adjectives. Next, we examined material from languages with verbal statives, which correspond to adjectival meanings in Russian and other languages similar to Russian. The result here was the conclusion that statives — both qualities and resultatives — are lexically equivalent to "adjectives in the narrow sense" — adjectivals.

We also undertook a detailed analysis of Russian adjectival predication. Such a discussion has two important consequences for us. Firstly, we developed and refined the previously proposed analysis of nominal predication with FFs as a nominal projection. Our refinement amounted to the type of nominal projection that the adjective represents in this case – we tried to show that such a nominal projection is the `adjP` head, corresponding to the adjective's FF. The `adjP` head of the FF possesses all relevant nominal features, and there is no need for an additional (null, generic, etc.) nominal head. We also showed that predicatively used FF forms are a projection of Atr, i.e., attributives, not adjectivals.

An important result of this section for further discussion was our proposed approach to SFs as projections containing the `res` head, analogous to statives in languages with "verbal" adjectives. We will elaborate on this idea later in this chapter, as well as in Chapter 3.

(229) [There is no (229) example label in the Russian text, this seems to be a formatting artifact. I will proceed with 2.3. and the subsequent examples.]

## 2.3. Secondary Predication: Depictives and Resultatives vs. Appositives-Dislocated Elements

Below, we will discuss some types of regular adjective usages that fall outside the scope of attributive and predicative functions (and are not related to comparative uses). We will first address cases of secondary predication, which include depictives and resultatives, and then discuss appositives-dislocated elements.

## 2.3.1. Depictives

Depictive secondary predication refers to the use of adjective phrases or noun phrases as an additional predicate with verbs that are not existential verbs. Our discussion will largely draw on Russian material analyzed in works such as (Nichols 1981; Bailyn 2001; 2002; 2012; Filip 2001; Richardson 2001; 2007; Strigin, Demjjanow 2001; Grebenyova 2005; Pereltsvaig 2007; Matushansky 2008b; Markman 2008) and others.

In Russian, secondary predications can be considered all uses of nominal predicates with verbs other than `byt'` 'to be', `stat'` ('sdelat'sya') 'to become', and `kazat'sya` 'to seem'. The three listed verbs allow the adjective SF, which is ungrammatical with other verbs:

(228)
(Internet)
a. Protaranivshiy kiosk voditel' byl p'yan.
   'The driver who rammed the kiosk was drunk (SF).'
b. On chuvstvoval, chto so sta pyatidesyati grammov kon'yaka stal p'yan.
   'He felt that after one hundred and fifty grams of cognac, he became drunk (SF).'
c. Vladelets mashiny kazalsya p'yan, no ot testa na alkogol' otkazalsya.
   'The car owner seemed drunk (SF), but refused an alcohol test.'
(229)
a. *Petya prishel p'yan.
   '*Petya came drunk (SF).'
b. *Ya privel Petyu p'yan.
   '*I brought Petya drunk (SF).'
c. *On pochuvstvoval sebya p'yan.
   '*He felt drunk (SF).'

At the same time, Russian adjective FFs can be used coreferentially with the subject or another participant and agree with it in case:

(230)
(Internet)
a. Vchera muzh prishel domoy p'yanyy.
   'Yesterday my husband came home drunk (FF).'
b. Dyadya Yefim privel yego p'yanogo.
   'Uncle Yefim brought him drunk (ACC FF).'
c. Nekotoryye tut schitayut, chto yesli urod popalsya p'yanym na chuzhoy mashine, to sovershenno tochno khozyain yeyo peredal yemu uzhe p'yanomu.
   'Some here believe that if a scoundrel was caught drunk (INSTR FF) in someone else's car, then the owner definitely handed it over to him already drunk (DAT FF).'

Such examples of secondary predications are called depictives; we will also discuss resultatives a little later.

Let's say a few words about why depictive SFs are ungrammatical. Earlier, we proposed that the SF head contains a `res` projection, corresponding to a sub-event responsible for a state or result. If this is so, then the state introduced by the short form must receive a temporal anchor. According to the proposed idea of the "tense chain," see (Hoekstra 2004: 125-218) and others, a chain of functional projections C-T-Asp-v-V is responsible for the temporal anchoring of a situation. The SF can be an element of such a chain, acting, as we saw above, as a complement of the T head. The depictive position, as we will show later, is related to adjunction. Consequently, the embedding into the temporal chain of a situation defined by the `res` head associated with the SF is impossible. Adjective FFs do not have a head responsible for resultativity, and therefore allow for depictive usage.

Note that in Russian of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the depictive use of SFs was quite common:

(231)
(A. I. Kuprin. "Granatovyy braslet" [The Garnet Bracelet], 1911)
Yesli on seychas vyskochil nevredim - vsyo ravno v budushchem schitay yego pogibshim.
'If he escaped unharmed (SF) now, still consider him lost in the future.'
(232)
(A. F. Koni. "Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov", 1911)
Ya ne mog ponyat', chtoby tot, pred kem ya sklonyal myslenno koleni, lezhal bezdykhanen.
'I could not understand how he, before whom I mentally knelt, could lie breathless (SF).'

This may be related to the evolution of SFs from attributive to predicative usage, structurally expressed by the inclusion of the `res` projection in their composition. If one assumes that SFs drift diachronically towards stative usage and that `res` is a relatively recent formation, one can explain the comparatively recent ungrammaticality of SF-depictives.

Let's return to FFs. The main difference between depictives and appositive detached constructions (see below) is as follows: i) in the case of a depictive, the verb typically precedes the secondary predicate, and the situations they describe are related; ii) there is no pause before the secondary predicate, but there is a pause before an appositive. The first condition can be demonstrated using example (230c) above. This example suggests that the state of 'being drunk' existed at the moment the action began. With non-delimited predicates, however, it is possible for the state to be acquired during the course of the main verb's action:

(233)
(Internet)
a. On shel domoy ustalyy.
   'He walked home tired (FF).'
b. Devochka rosla zdorovaya.
   'The girl grew up healthy (FF).'

Whether it is precedence or simultaneity, the temporal connection between the situation described by the verb and the depictive is crucial. This distinguishes depictives from detached appositives, cf.: `Vasya peredal den'gi Pete, dovol'nomu svoim vyigryshem` 'Vasya handed the money to Petya, who was happy about his winnings'; `On shel domoy, samyy schastlivyy chelovek na svete` 'He walked home, the happiest man in the world'.

As is known, besides the agreement strategy, Russian also allows for the marking of secondary predication with the instrumental case:

(234)
a. Muzh prishel domoy p'yanym.
   'My husband came home drunk (INSTR).'
b. Dyadya Yefim_i privel yego_j p'yanym_i/j.
   'Uncle Yefim_i brought him_j drunk (INSTR)_i/j.'
c. Khozyain_i peredal mashinu voditelyu_j uzhe p'yanym_i/*j.
   'The owner_i handed the car over to the driver_j already drunk (INSTR)_i/*j.'

We see that the secondary predicate in the instrumental case can refer only to the subject or direct object, but not to indirectly-object nominal groups, see (234c). Instrumental depictives should be distinguished from lexical complements of verbs like `kazat'sya` 'to seem':

(235)
a. Ivan kazhetsya glupym / *glupyy.
   'Ivan seems stupid (INSTR) / *stupid (NOM).'
b. Ya schitayu Ivana glupym / *glupogo.
   'I consider Ivan stupid (INSTR) / *stupid (ACC).'

In the case of verbs like `kazat'sya` 'to seem', `schitat'` 'to consider', etc., one can speak of valency for the instrumental case, or, in our terms, that such verbs take a PredP as a complement, which assigns the instrumental case.

Instrumental and agreeing usage are contrasted not only by the syntactic contexts in which they are permissible. Various researchers have pointed out a semantic contrast between agreement and instrumental strategy, see (Nichols 1981; Filip 2001; Richardson 2007; Markman 2008) and others. Possible reasons for using one form or another were linked, in particular, to the distinction between individual-level and stage-level adjectives. It was established, however, that both individual-level (a) and stage-level (b) adjectives can be used with either form:

(236)
a. Devochka rosla umnaya / umnoy.
   'The girl grew up smart (NOM FF) / smart (INSTR FF).'
b. Muzh prishel domoy p'yanyy / p'yanym.
   'My husband came home drunk (NOM FF) / drunk (INSTR FF).'

In (Richardson 2007), the following examples from East Slavic languages are given:

(237)
(Richardson 2007: 123)
Ivan prishel domoy iz bol'nitsy zdorovyy / zdorovym.
'Ivan came home from the hospital healthy (NOM FF) / healthy (INSTR FF).'

(238) Belarusian
(Richardson 2007: 123)
Yanka priyshov dadomu z shpitalya zdarovy / zdarovym.
came.3SG.M home from hospital healthy-NOM / healthy-INSTR
'Yanka came home from the hospital healthy (NOM) / healthy (INSTR).'

(239) Ukrainian
(Richardson 2007: 124)
Borys pryyshov dodomu z lykarny zdorovyy / zdorovym.
came.3SG.M home from hospital healthy-NOM / healthy-INSTR
'Borys came home from the hospital healthy (NOM) / healthy (INSTR).'

According to Richardson's conclusion, see (Richardson 2007: 124), the agreement strategy is characterized by the following semantic features: i) there is no implication of a change of state as a result of the verb's action; ii) there is no assertion that the object has definitively transitioned into the state prescribed by the adjective; iii) the state prescribed by the adjective may be actual at the moment of speech, i.e., it is not tied to a specific time interval. The features of instrumental interpretation according to (Richardson 2007) are as follows: i) during the action described by the verb, the object transitioned into the state defined by the adjective (went to the hospital not being healthy and recovered there); ii) the transition to the new state ('to be healthy') occurred definitively; iii) by the moment of speech, the state may have already changed (came healthy, but is no longer healthy now), i.e., the state defined by the adjective is associated with a specific point in time.

In the case of non-delimited predicates, however, the mentioned contrast is not observed:

(240)
(Internet)
a. On shel ustalyy.
   'He walked tired (FF).'
a′. On shel ustalym.
   'He walked tired (INSTR FF).'
b. Devochka rosla zdorovaya.
   'The girl grew up healthy (FF).'
b′. Devochka rosla zdorovoy.
   'The girl grew up healthy (INSTR FF).'

In both variants of the example `On shel ustalyy / ustalym` ('He walked tired / tired'), the state of 'being tired' most likely occurred before the person started walking. In both agreement and instrumental cases, there is no information about how definitive the transition to this state is, cf.: `Pervuyu chast' puti on shel ustalyy / ustalym, no potom vypil chayu i vsyu ostal'nuyu dorogu ispytyval priliv sil.` 'He walked the first part of the way tired (NOM/INSTR), but then drank tea and felt a surge of energy for the rest of the journey.'

Researchers have made various attempts to explain the meaning of transition to a new state, ascribed by the depictive, associated with the instrumental case (in the context of delimited predicates). In (Markman 2008), it is proposed that a special head, PredEv, responsible for the instrumental, also introduces an event argument. A similar solution is proposed in (Matushansky 2008b), where the instrumental is declared to be the phonological realization (composition) of case features on the eventive head `v` and the Pred head.

Let's discuss the internal structure and external distribution of agreeing and instrumental depictives. Let's start with the following fact, noted in (Pereltsvaig 2007: 131-132; Geist 2010: 242-245; Bailyn 2012: 178) and others. Agreeing usage is possible only for an adjective phrase, but not for a noun phrase:

| 160   | Chapter 2. Adjectivity      |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| (241) | (Geist 2010: 242, 245)      |
| (242) | (Internet)                  |
| (243) | *Devochka rosla umnitsa.    |
|       | '*The girl grew up a smart girl (NOM).' |

²⁵ The use of agreeing nominal groups in the position of a secondary predicate was possible in previous stages of the Russian language; today, such examples are perceived as archaic. Note that synchronous constructions with nominal groups in nominal predication are possible, cf.: `Yego syn byl ofitser` 'His son was an officer'; `Yeyo doch' byla bol'shaya umnitsa` 'Her daughter was a great smart girl'.

One can conclude that agreeing depictives with adjective FFs are backed by structures that do not coincide with noun phrases. Following (Bailyn 2012) and others, we will assume that agreeing secondary predications represent "bare" adjective FF projections, `adjP`. At the same time, we associate the presence of the instrumental case in depictive (as well as predicative) FFs with the PredP projection, whose head assigns case to the depictive predicate.

As in the case of nominal predication, the case marking of the depictive in agreement is determined by which position the adjective's internal subject occupies in the clause structure; see a similar approach in (Grebenyova 2005). Consider the following examples:

(244)
a. Priyti na rabotu p'yanym / *p'yanyy ne vkhodilo v moi plany.
   'To come to work drunk (INSTR) / *drunk (NOM) was not part of my plans.'
b. Ya ne khotel priyti na rabotu p'yanym / p'yanyy.
   'I didn't want to come to work drunk (INSTR) / drunk (NOM).'

In example (a), where the infinitive itself occupies the subject position, the subject of the infinitive clause is linked to arbitrary control. In example (b), conversely, the subject raises from the infinitive's subject position, as a result of which it can transmit the nominative feature down the derivation chain. Agreeing nominative usage of the depictive, therefore, is available only in (b), but not in (a).

The reliability of the infinitive test can be confirmed by the so-called floating quantifier `sam` 'self', see, for example, (Madariaga 2006). When correlated with an infinitive subject, such units can appear either in the nominative or in the dative — if the nominative is unavailable:

(245)
(Internet)
a. Pogibat' samomu ne vkhodilo v yego plany.
   'To die oneself (DAT) was not part of his plans.'
b. Ya ne khotel ukhodit' sam.
   'I didn't want to leave myself (NOM).'

(246)
a. *Pogibat' sam ne vkhodilo v yego plany.
   '*To die oneself (NOM) was not part of his plans.'
b. *Ya ne khotel ukhodit' samomu.
   '*I didn't want to leave myself (DAT).'

The availability of the nominative feature, therefore, is observed only in raising predicates (b) — precisely in those cases where agreeing depictives are possible. In the case of subject infinitives, the depictive can be in the instrumental, but not in the nominative, because the nominative case feature cannot be spread by the subject from the matrix predication²⁶.

²⁶ For a number of speakers, dative marking is also possible - analogously to the floating `sam` 'self': `Priyti na rabotu p'yanomu ne vkhodilo v moi plany.` 'To come to work drunk (DAT) was not part of my plans.'

Let's consider the case of control from a direct object:

(247)
(Grebenyova 2005: 77)
Pavel poprosil Ivana ne idti na prazdnik *grustnogo / grustnym.
'Pavel asked Ivan not to go to the party *sad (ACC) / sad (INSTR).'

In (Grebenyova 2005), which also proposes a derivational approach to the formation of depictives, the following argumentation is presented. To check the accusative feature, the noun phrase `Ivan` must raise into the matrix vP from the position of the local subject of the secondary predication. The acquisition of the accusative feature during such a derivation, thus, turns out to be "delayed." By the time it is necessary to check the case feature on the secondary predicate, the accusative value has not yet been obtained.

So, we can construct a structure for agreeing and instrumental depictives. Both are adjuncts, and therefore can attach to verb phrases or TP, see (Madariaga 2006; Richardson 2007; Matushansky 2008b; Bailyn 2012).

In our view, the case of the secondary predicate in the case of agreeing depictives is determined by the position in which its internal subject completes its derivation. This distinguishes our approach from a number of previous ones, which proposed that the case of the secondary predicate in agreement is determined by the level of adjunction. In (Bailyn 2012: 188-189), it is hypothesized that if the agreeing adjective phrase is an adjunct of TP, it receives nominative, and if of vP, accusative. In (Richardson 2007: 138-141), the levels of adjunction for subject- and object-oriented depictives are defined as vP and VP, respectively. However, we believe that such an approach does not account for the above-mentioned facts of infinitive distribution. If adjunction alone were sufficient for case acquisition, the contrast in infinitive distribution presented above would not exist.

Our analysis can be presented as follows:

(248) Subject-oriented depictive
<!-- image -->

The subject noun phrase moves out of the adjective's internal subject position and passes through the Spec, VP position, where it receives a semantic role from the verb. Such movement constitutes a case of so-called sideward movement and violates the c-command condition necessary for chain formation. The possibility of such movement, however, is inevitable under a movement theory of control and has been justified in (Hornstein 2001; Nunes 2004) and other works.

Structures with agreeing object-oriented depictives are formed in the same way:

(249) Object-oriented depictive
<!-- image -->

In this case, the adjective phrase is also an adjunct of the verb phrase. Accusative assignment occurs after: i) the subject of the adjective phrase moves to the Spec, VP position, where it receives a semantic role from the verb; ii) the verbal head moves to the `v` position, from which the accusative feature will be distributed down the structure, see (Lyutikova 2017a: 48-61).

In the case of agreeing depictives at any level, one can speak of a multiple agreement mechanism: the same source of case (TP, vP, etc.) realizes the case feature on both the argumental noun phrase and the secondary predicate, see (Bailyn 2012: 188-189).

Let's turn to the instrumental strategy. As in the case of nominal predication with SFs, the Pred head is responsible for the instrumental. Instrumental marking of a depictive with dative tri-argument verbs is impossible, while the agreement strategy is permissible²⁷:

(250)
(Internet)
a. Nekotoryye tut schitayut, chto yesli urod popalsya p'yanym na chuzhoy mashine, to sovershenno tochno khozyain yeyo peredal yemu uzhe p'yanomu.
   'Some here believe that if a scoundrel was caught drunk (INSTR) in someone else's car, then the owner definitely handed it over to him already drunk (DAT).'
b. Zlodei vtoropyakh ne umeli snyat' doroguyu grivnu i dlya togo otrubili yemu golovu uzhe mertvomu.
   'In their haste, the villains couldn't remove the expensive hryvnia and for that purpose cut off his head already dead (DAT).'

(251)
a. *Khozyain peredal mashinu voditelyu_j uzhe p'yanym_j.
   '*The owner handed the car over to the driver_j already drunk (INSTR)_j.'
b. *Zlodei otrubili yemu golovu uzhe mertvym.
   '*The villains cut off his head already dead (INSTR).'

²⁷ It is noteworthy that sometimes the instrumental is possible, for example, in the case of preposed adjective phrases and experiential dative: `Eshche malen'kim mne nravilos' begat' k kedram` 'When I was still little (INSTR), I liked to run to the cedars' (Internet).

Furthermore, the context of oblique cases appears ungrammatical for both types of depictives; let's provide examples with verbs governing the instrumental²⁸:

(252)
a. *Direktor upravlyal zavodom_j sovsem bednym_j.
   '*The director managed the factory_j quite poor (INSTR)_j.'
b. *Vrag zavladel gorodom uzhe pustym.
   '*The enemy took possession of the city already empty (INSTR).'
c. *Vse verteli Petey bezvol'nym.
   '*Everyone manipulated Petya (INSTR) spineless (INSTR).'

²⁸ Note that all such examples can become grammatical with special intonational emphasis. In this case, they already represent an appositive construction, see below.

To summarize: instrumental depictives (PredP) are possible only in the context of a subject and a direct object, while for agreeing depictives (adjP), the dative is also available. Thus, we need to explain two facts: i) the availability of direct case contexts for both types of depictives; ii) the unavailability of the dative participant for the instrumental depictive.

The first fact directly follows from our analysis: being adjuncts, depictives can only modify constituents (TP, vp, VP, ...), i.e., they are associated with positions where structural case is assigned. This makes it impossible for them to be coreferential with participants in inherent cases.

The unavailability of the dative participant for the instrumental can be explained if we consider the dative a structural case, assigned, however, quite locally, "at merge," in the spirit of (Bailyn 2012). Depictives that assign the instrumental may give rise to a case conflict, characteristic of oblique cases in constructions with more than one source of a case feature. In cases like `*Kazhdyy direktor upravlyal po zavodu` '*Every director managed *according to the factory' etc., the distributive preposition `po` locally assigns a case feature that conflicts with the case received from the verb. Similar reasons can lead to the ungrammaticality of the dative with a depictive instrumental. Ungrammaticality in this case may arise due to a conflict between the locally assigned dative and the instrumental assigned by the Prep head, as, for example, in cases with the preposition `po`, cf.: `*Ministerstvo vydelilo zavod po direktoru` '*The ministry allocated the factory *according to the director'. The formation of an instrumental depictive correlated with a subject or object, however, should not cause problems, as the nominative and accusative are acquired during derivation, only after Pred assigns the instrumental. Let's assume that the dative — in the spirit of (Bailyn 2012: 140-160) — is a structural case, assigned locally. Then both the dative feature and the instrumental feature are assigned to the secondary predicate locally, immediately upon the depictive entering the derivation, which leads to a case conflict, see, for example, structure (51) (Ibid.: 148). As in (Bailyn 2012), we consider depictives to be adjuncts. The difference between our approach and J. Bailyn's approach is that, from our point of view, case "percolates" to the secondary predicate during derivation and feature checking, rather than being acquired as a result of adjunction. We will leave a more detailed analysis for the future.

Subjects of nominal predication (whether main or secondary) must receive a semantic role. Such a role can be assigned either within the adjectival projection Adj, or by the Pred head. In the case of agreeing secondary predicates, as we have seen, the Pred head is absent (otherwise it is difficult to explain the ungrammaticality of agreeing nominal predicates-nouns). If only an adjective phrase is possible in the role of an agreeing predicate, then only adjectivals, but not attributives, can be used as a secondary predicate. Indeed, only adjectivals can assign a semantic role to a participant within the Adj projection. Such a prediction, it seems to us, is borne out²⁹:

(253)
Rayon voshel v sostav Moskvy uzhe promyshlennym / *promyshlennyy / ?ogromnyy.
'The district entered the composition of Moscow already industrial (INSTR) / *industrial (NOM) / ?huge (NOM).'
Moskva poglotila novyy rayon uzhe promyshlennym / *promyshlennyy / ??ogromnyy.
'Moscow absorbed the new district already industrial (INSTR) / *industrial (NOM) / ??huge (NOM).'

(254)
Kvartira prodavalas' dvukhkomnatnoy / *dvukhkomnatnaya / uzhe staraya.
'The apartment was sold two-room (INSTR) / *two-room (NOM) / already old (NOM).'
Petya prodaval kvartiru dvukhkomnatnoy / *dvukhkomnatnuyu / uzhe staruyu.
'Petya sold the apartment two-room (INSTR) / *two-room (ACC) / already old (ACC).'

²⁹ These examples should be distinguished from cases of topicalization of the head noun: `Devushka (ona) rosla umnaya t devushka.` 'The girl (she) grew up a smart t girl.'

The grammaticality of agreeing depictives that have SFs (`ogromen` 'huge', `star` 'old', ...) and thus possess an Adj projection, is not always absolute. One reason is that the semantic restrictions on the use of depictives are not fully clear. However, the contrast between attributives like `promyshlennyy` 'industrial', `dvukhkomnatnyy` 'two-room', etc., on the one hand, and adjectivals like `ogromnyy` 'huge', `staryy` 'old', etc., on the other, appears to be real.

Let's say a few words about the typology of depictive case marking. A number of languages opt for a strictly agreement strategy, cf.:

(255) Polish
(Richardson 2007:109)
Wyszedłem bogaty / ??/* bogatym, wróciłem biedny / ??/* biednym.
left.1SG wealthy-NOM / ??/* wealthy-INS returned.1SG poor-NOM / ??/* poor-INS
'I left wealthy and returned poor.'

a. T͡ydy Masha-m vashlin sylyk.
   He Masha-ACC met sad
   'He met Masha sad.'
b. T͡ydy Masha-m sylyk-ym vashlin.
   He Masha-ACC sad-ACC met
   'He met Masha sad.'

In other languages, on the contrary, the secondary predicate requires case marking that differs from the case of its subject. For example, in Ossetian, the ablative is used for depictive contexts, while the nominative is used in nominal predication:

(257) Ossetian
Nyjjardžyttæ Alan-y sx'omyl kodtoj tyx"džyn-æj / *tyx"džyn.
Parents Alan-GEN raised strong-ABL / strong
'Parents raised Alan strong.'

(258) Ossetian
Mæ caexæradon styr / *styr-æj u.
my garden big / big-ABL COP
'My garden is big.'

In Buryat, the instrumental is also preferred with depictives:

(259) Buryat
Modon ündər-өөr ur-gaa.
Tree high-INS grow-IPF
'The tree grew tall.'

(260) Buryat
Bi shülə xaluun-aar edi-deg-bi.
I soup.ACC hot-INS eat-HAB-1.SG
'I eat soup hot.'

In Finnish, two cases are used for coding secondary predication: the essive and the translative. The essive is reserved for the depictive, and the translative for the resultative:

(261) Finnish
(Fong 2003: 204)
a. Sointu paisto-i kala-n kuiva-na.
   Sointu.NOM fry-PST.3.SG fish-ACC raw-ESS
   'Sointu fries the fish raw.'
b. Sointu paisto-i kala-n kuiva-ksi.
   Sointu.NOM fry-PST.3.SG fish-ACC raw-TRS
   'Sointu fries the fish raw.'

## 2.3.2. Resultatives

The Finnish examples from the previous section demonstrate the following: i) in addition to depictive, there is also resultative usage of adjectives; ii) Russian (see translation) is not sensitive to distinguishing between depictives and resultatives. The following Finnish example can demonstrate a context more characteristic of a resultative:

(262) Finnish
(Matushansky 2012: 9)
Me maalas-i-mme seinä-n keltaise-ksi.
We paint-PAST-1.PL wall-ACC yellow-TRS
'We painted the wall yellow.'

The Russian translation in this case is not entirely accurate. The instrumental depictive in Russian carries the meaning of acquiring a certain feature by a specific moment. However, the moment the new state begins is not linked to the action of the main verb. In the case of a resultative, the onset of the state described by the adjective is the result of the verb's action. Classic examples of resultatives are the following English sentences:

(263) English
a. John hammered the metal flat.
   'John hammered the metal so that it became flat.'
b. John kicked the door closed.
   'John kicked the door so that it closed.'

(264) English
a. John talked himself hoarse.
   'John talked so much that he became hoarse.'
b. John ran his sneakers threadbare.
   'John ran so much that his sneakers became worn out.'

The action described by the main verb (John hammers the metal, kicks the door, talks, runs) leads to the onset of the state described by the resultative adjective (the metal is flattened, the door is closed, John is hoarse, the sneakers are worn out). The second pair of sentences above presents intransitive verbs that, in the absence of a resultative adjective, are ungrammatical with a direct object: `*John talked himself`; `*John ran his sneakers`. The use of a reflexive in the context of a resultative constitutes a case of so-called fake reflexives.

The Russian language does not have resultative constructions with adjectives or participles:

(265)
a. *Dzhon rasplyushchil metall ploskim / ploskiy.
   '*John flattened the metal flat (INSTR) / flat (NOM).'
b. *Dzhon pnul dver' zakrytoy / zakrytuyu.
   '*John kicked the door closed (INSTR) / closed (ACC).'
c. *Dzhon zagovoril sebya khriplym / khriplogo.
   '*John talked himself hoarse (INSTR) / hoarse (ACC).'
d. *Dzhon vybegal svoi krossovki stoptannymi / stoptannyye.
   '*John ran his sneakers worn out (INSTR) / worn out (ACC).'

At the same time, Russian allows the use of resultative adverbs and prepositional phrases in the same contexts:

(266)
a. Dzhon rasplyushchil metall v lepeshku.
   'John flattened the metal into a pancake.'
b. Dzhon otkryl dver' naraspashku.
   'John opened the door wide open.'
c. Dzhon nagovorilsya do khripoty.
   'John talked himself hoarse.'
d. Dzhon iznosil krossovki do dyr.
   'John wore out his sneakers until holes (appeared).'

Typologically, resultatives appear to be a rarer construction than depictives. For example, in Kalmyk and Ossetian, the resultative use of adjectives is also ungrammatical:

(267) Kalmyk
*Bi ger /-in ulan shirdv.
I house/-ACC red painted
Intended: 'I painted the house so that it became red.'

(268) Ossetian
*Alan a-lenk kodta fællad-æj / fællad.
Alan PREF-swam tired-ABL / tired
i) '*Alan swam so much that he became tired.'
ii) 'Alan swam tired.'

Here are examples of adjectives functioning as resultatives outside of English:

(269) German
(Kratzer 2005: 177)
die Teekanne leer trinken
DEF teapot empty drink
'drink the teapot empty.'

(270) Warlpiri
(Simpson 2005: 85)
Yulpu-karda janka-ja pirrjirdi-wangu-karda, yilara.
Soft-TRS fry-PST hard-CAR-TRS meat
'It fried the meat to a soft state, so that it is no longer (pleasant and) hard.'

Adjectives marked with the translative (cf. Finnish!) in Warlpiri can function as both depictives and resultatives (Simpson 2005); the example above presents a resultative.

Resultatives are close to another well-known phenomenon in the world's languages: serialization. One regular type of serialization is formed with the participation of a verb and an adjective (stative) and possesses resultative semantics:

(271) East Kayah
(Solnit 2006: 149)
ʔa ce li bēʔū.
3.SG paint red clothes
'He/she painted the clothes so that they became red.'

(272) Semelai
(Kruspe 2004: 301)
Cɔkwɛn βəp!
throw.out be.far
'Throw (it) far away!'

Resultatives and serial constructions are similar in that: i) they have the meaning of transitioning into a final state, defined by the adjective; ii) the internal participant of the situation defined by the verb is the sole participant of the situation defined by the adjective³⁰.

³⁰ There are other variants of semantic role combinations, but this one represents a fairly stable pattern.

M. Baker (Baker 2003) considers resultative constructions quite important for understanding the nature of adjectives and their distinction from nouns and verbs. We have seen that both nominal and adjectival projections can participate in the formation of depictives (in the case of Russian depictives, nominal groups are necessarily marked with the instrumental case). At the same time, as Baker notes, resultatives (in English) can only be adjective phrases, see (Ibid.: 219-230). According to Baker, resultatives are more firmly, or "tightly integrated," into the verb phrase than depictives (Ibid.: 220). This is expressed in the following distributional features.

Firstly, resultatives must be located before prepositional phrases with instrumental semantics (a), while depictives can follow such PPs (b):

(273)
(Baker 2004: 220)
a. I wiped the table (clean) with a damp cloth (*clean).
   'I wiped the table (clean = 'thoroughly') with a damp cloth (*clean = 'thoroughly').'
b. I ate the meat (?raw) with a fork (raw).
   'I ate the meat (?raw) with a fork (raw).'

Secondly, if both secondary predicates are present in a sentence, the resultative always precedes the depictive:

(274)
(Baker 2004: 220)
a. I washed the car clean cold.
   'I washed the car clean while frozen.'
b. *I washed the car cold clean.
   '*I washed the car frozen clean.'

Thirdly, only depictives, but not resultatives, can follow the verb phrase of a bitransitive verb:

(275)
(Baker 2004: 220)
a. *I broke Chris a coconut open.
   'I broke a coconut for Chris so that it opened.'
b. I gave Chris the meat raw.
   'I gave Chris the meat raw.'

Fourthly, resultative constructions (in English) are always object-oriented (a)³¹, while depictives can refer to either the object (b) or the subject (c):

(276)
(Baker 2004: 220)
a. The file_i sanded the wood_j smooth_*i/j.
   'The file sanded the wood so that it became smooth.'

³¹ Cf., however, examples like `The water froze solid`, as well as cases of "fake reflexives" like `John talked himself hoarse`, etc.

b. I ate the meat raw.
   'I ate the meat raw.'
c. I left Chris angry.
   'I_i left Chris_j angry_i/j.'

Based on these facts, Baker proposes a decompositional analysis of verb structure, including an adjectival resultative:

(277) Structure of predication with a resultative according to (Baker 2004: 221)

<!-- image -->

According to (Baker 2004), the verb phrase, containing various levels of lexical projection, includes a resulting state, expressed in the case of the verb `wipe` by the adjective `wiped`. Above such an adjective phrase,

³² `I wiped the table clean` 'I wiped the table clean'.

lexical projections responsible for the eventive part of the situation are built. The syntactic "sister" of the adjective `wiped` in this case becomes the adjective `clean`, which, according to Baker, is also part of the verb phrase.

Baker's analysis accurately describes the fact that resultative adjectives form a single event with the verb. Indeed, the observed restriction in various contexts on the obligatory collocation of the verb phrase and the resultative adjective indicates that both predicates form one situation with a common set of participants. An approach that assumes the unification of the argument and event structures of two predicates is also well-suited for describing serial constructions involving adjectives. However, Baker's proposed analysis, it seems to us, is not free from certain empirical and conceptual shortcomings.

As an example of facts that are poorly explained by the approach to resultatives as incorporation, the following can be mentioned. Baker provides an explanation for why combinations of two adjectives, `wiped` + `clean`; 'wiped' + 'clean', can be grammatical. According to Baker, this is possible – unlike nominal predications (see above) – because each adjective in this case is part of a subevent defined by the verb. This approach, however, does not explain the prohibition on multiple branching of adjectives, similar to what is grammatical in the context of a noun phrase, cf.: `*John wiped the floor clean white slippery` 'John polished the floor so that it became clean, white, slippery.'

The following can be considered a conceptual shortcoming of Baker's analysis of secondary predications. Baker's key assumption is the claim that an adjective phrase is incapable of projecting its own specifier. Adjectives, according to Baker, can express a subject only indirectly; for this, they must be part of a verb phrase. To explain the distribution of resultative adjectives, Baker proposes a technically complex solution involving the incorporation of an adjective (phrase) into the lexical structure of the verb. Incorporation is necessary to justify the absence of a specifier

in the adjectival projection. To explain the ungrammaticality of nouns and verbs as resultatives, Baker appeals to the properties of nouns and verbs themselves. From Baker's point of view, the structure of nouns and verbs is "redundant" for them to perform the function of a resultative. The use of nouns in this function is hindered by their referential index, and that of verbs by their semantic role; see (Baker 2003: 224-225) for more details. Adjectives are devoid of both properties and can therefore be part of a complex verb phrase.

Such an approach, it seems to us, involves non-trivial additional assumptions. If, on the contrary, one acknowledges the ability of adjectives to project their own subject, the observed facts can receive a simpler explanation.

As we established above, depictives – both in English and in Russian – are adjuncts. It can be assumed that the difference between resultatives and depictives lies in the fact that the projection of the resultative adjective can be considered a complement of the verb phrase. The unification of the event and argument structures, it seems to us, is a result of the attachment of the resultative structure, containing its own subject, as a complement (cf., for example, phase verbs, whose complements are infinitives).

Thus, verbs denoting a process with a resultative have the optional ability to take an adjective phrase as a complement. The question of how this "valency" is technically realized will be set aside. (This could occur, for example, through the building of an additional functional shell in the verbal structure.) The hypothesis that the resultative structure functions as a complement to the verb has been developed in a number of works, see, for example, (Hoekstra 2004) et al. In (Hoekstra 2004: 295-390), the resultative is analyzed in terms of a small clause. According to (Kratzer 2005), however, resultatives do not require additional structure in the form of a small clause, as the adjectives forming them possess only an internal argument. Within the framework of our proposed analysis, the structure of resultative phrases can be presented as follows:

(278) Structure of predication with a resultative

<!-- image -->

In accordance with the adopted assumptions, the adjective projects its subject into Spec, AdjP. The commonality of the argument structure is ensured by the fact that the adjective's internal subject, having received a semantic role from it, raises to Spec, VP, where it also receives the role of theme / patient from the verb. An approach that assumes the raising and unification of semantic roles is proposed in (Hoekstra 2004; Embick 2004; Kratzer 2005; Jeong 2006) and other works. Thus, recognizing the ability to express its own subject allows for the explanation of a unified argument structure.

A. Kratzer (Kratzer 2005) also suggests that the situations defined by the verb and the adjective are connected by a direct causation relation. Adjectives are also incapable of independently expressing aspectual-temporal meanings. The moment of onset of the resulting state defined by the adjectives and its correlation with other stages of the situation are thus determined by the verb's aspectual-temporal characteristics. These two facts – the causation relation and the adjective's dependence on the aspectual-temporal meanings expressed by the verbal projection – ensure the commonality of the event structure.

The documented restrictions on the placement of the resultative adjective (precedence over prepositional phrases

and depictives, etc.) are explained by the rules governing the organization of the verb phrase. The relative position of the direct object and the resultative adjective is strictly fixed – just as it is in the case of bitransitive verbs, cf. `John [sent [a letter] [to Mary]]`; `John [hammered [the metal] [flat]]`, see (Larson 1988).

Our proposed approach has additional advantages. Firstly, it can explain cases of transitivization of intransitive verbs in English, cf.: `John talked himself hoarse` vs. `*John talked himself`. The missing syntactic position in this case can be provided precisely by Spec, AdjP.

Furthermore, the prohibition on nominal and verbal resultative projections in English and the prohibition on any resultative projections in Russian can be explained by the same mechanism. Verbs in English allow only resultative complements with the Adj feature. Only adjectives, but not participles, are possible as resultatives, cf.: `*The joggers ran themselves exhausted` (Kratzer 2005).

In Russian, no category can function as a resultative. Both facts are explained by complementation restrictions: in English, only projections with the Adj feature can occupy the resultative position. In Russian, attributive projections with any feature, whether Adj (adjective) or V (verb), can never function as a verb complement. Therefore, SFs of Russian adjectives (Adj feature) or participles (V feature) also cannot form resultatives, cf.: `*Petya rasplyushchil metall tonok / razmazan.` '*Petya flattened the metal thin / spread out.'

## 2.3.3. Appositive Detachments

In Russian, two types of discontinuous constructions with adjectives regularly occur: postposition and left dislocation. In postposition, detached attributes are placed after the head noun, often contiguously (`snegiri — neobyknovennye sredi moroza i snega` 'bullfinches — unusual amidst the frost and snow'), sometimes discontinuously (`arestanty poshli domoy, ustalyye, no sovershenno dovol'nyye` 'the prisoners went home, tired, but completely satisfied'):

(279)
(SinTagRus)
Murlykali i delovito koposhilis' na torcashchem iz-pod snega tatarnike snegiri -neobyknovennye sredi moroza i snega, kak tropicheskiye ptitsy…
'The bullfinches purred and busily bustled on the tatarnik sticking out from under the snow — unusual amidst the frost and snow, like tropical birds…'

(280)
(F. M. Dostoyevsky. "Notes from the House of the Dead")
Rovno za polchasa do barabana zadannyy urok byl okonchen, i arestanty poshli domoy, ustalyye, no sovershenno dovol'nyye…
'Exactly half an hour before the drum, the assigned lesson was finished, and the prisoners went home, tired, but completely satisfied…'

With left dislocation, the adjective phrase is located at the absolute beginning of the sentence:

(281)
(SinTagRus)
«Vol'nyye v knyaz'yakh», novgorodtsy mogli prognat' knyazya, okazavshegosya neugodnym, i prizvat' na yego mesto drugogo, no knyazheskiy stol u nikh pochti nikogda ne byval vakantnym.
'"Free in princes," the Novgorodians could drive away a prince who proved displeasing, and summon another in his place, but their princely throne was almost never vacant.'

(282)
(SinTagRus)
Gromko razreklamirovannyy, yego proyekt opirayetsya na ofitsial'nuyu ideologiyu privedeniya strany v poryadok, chto dobavlyayet yemu privlekatel'nosti v glazakh kremlevskikh obitateley.
'Loudly advertised, his project relies on the official ideology of bringing the country to order, which adds to its appeal in the eyes of the Kremlin inhabitants.'

Despite the fact that it is sometimes problematic to insert additional material between the adjective and the noun, adjectives with left dislocation are not in their base position, as can be seen from the demonstrative pronoun in the case of `Gromko razreklamirovannyy, yego proyekt` ('Loudly advertised, his project') (instead of `yego gromko razreklamirovannyy proyekt` 'his loudly advertised project').

Both instances of such constructions will hereinafter be referred to as appositive detachment (AD). At first glance, the "condition for existence" of AD appears to be the presence of more than one attributive word form. Single adjectives in the same examples (and with neutral intonation) appear ungrammatical:

(283)
*Murlykali i koposhilis' snegiri neobyknovennye.
'*The bullfinches purred and bustled, unusual.'

(284)
*Razreklamirovannyy yego proyekt opirayetsya na ofitsial'nuyu ideologiyu.
'*His advertised project relies on the official ideology.'

Analogues of Russian ADs exist in other languages:

(285) English
(Internet)
a. …comfortable bed, and the bathroom, while not large, was quite adequate.
   '…a comfortable bed, and the bathroom, though not large, was quite adequate.'
b. Although not necessarily dirty, the rooms are old, the furniture is cheap.
   'Though not necessarily dirty, the rooms were old, the furniture - cheap.'

(286) French
(G. Flaubert. "Bouvard and Pécuchet")
Pecuchet, bilieux et de tendances autoritaires, se declara sansculotte et meme robespierriste.
'Bilious, authoritarian Pécuchet declared himself a sans-culotte and even a Robespierrist.'

(287) French
(T. Gautier. "Arria Marcella")
Voluptueux et positif, il ne se payait pas d'illusions et n'avait en amour aucun prejuge.
'Sensuous and grounded in his own experiences, he harbored no illusions and had no prejudices in love.'

Prosodic marking is key for ADs. The boundaries of the constituent are marked by a pause, and a falling tone is present on the adjective or at the end of the AD. In left dislocation, the pause is placed after the adjective (phrase), while in postposition, it is placed before it. With intonational marking, even single adjectives become grammatical:

(288)
Murlykali i koposhilis' snegiri, _neobyknovennye_ ↓ .
'The bullfinches purred and bustled, _unusual_ (falling tone).'

(289)
(SinTagRus)
Do poloviny proydena zemnaya zhizn', vperedi vtoraya polovina, _khudshaya_ ↓ .
'Half of earthly life has been passed, ahead is the second half, _the worst_ (falling tone).'

(290)
Razreklamirovannyy ↓ _, yego proyekt opirayetsya na ofitsial'nuyu ideologiyu.
'_Advertised_ (falling tone), his project relies on the official ideology.'

(291)
(Internet)
Rasstroyennaya ↓ _, moya zhena prinyalas' sobirat' so stola gryaznyye tarelki.
'_Upset_ (falling tone), my wife began to clear the dirty dishes from the table.'

From the perspective of information structure, ADs are always rhemes. Left-dislocated ADs are in focus, acquiring a possible meaning of cause or concession, see (Sannikov 2010).

In (AG-80-2: §§ 2108-2116), detached clauses are distinguished, which include participial / substantival / adjectival clauses, semi-predication, pre- and postposition. Example (a) below has a causal meaning, and (b) a concessive meaning:

(292)
(AG-80-2: §§ 2108)
a. Sogretyy solntsem, mokh rastsvyol belymi krokhotnymi tsvetami.
   'Warmed by the sun, the moss bloomed with tiny white flowers.'
b. Otrezannyye ot vsego mira, ural'tsy s chest'yu vyderzhali kazach'yu osadu.
   'Cut off from the whole world, the Ural Cossacks honorably withstood the Cossack siege.'

The overwhelming majority of examples with ADs contain either adjectives with their own dependents or conjoined adjectives. As for dependents, they can vary. The examples below consistently show cases of postposition and left dislocation with adjectives extended by prepositional-case forms or intensifiers:

(293)
(SinTagRus)
Spamery atakuyut domashniye komp'yutery, mnogiye iz kotorykh dazhe ne snabzheny bazovoy sistemoy zashchity firewall (sposobnoy obnaruzhivat' lyubyye vtorzheniya).
'Spammers attack home computers, many of which are not even equipped with a basic firewall protection system (capable of detecting any intrusions).'

(294)
(Internet)
Dovol'nyy svoyey zhizn'yu i kar'yeroy, etot chelovek, u kotorogo ne khvatilo vremeni zanyat'sya psikhoanalizom… gotov pogovorit' ob etom i mnogom drugom.
'Satisfied with his life and career, this man, who didn't have time for psychoanalysis… is ready to talk about this and much more.'

(295)
(SinTagRus)
Prichem rech' idet o glubinnom, vnutrennem stresse, vneshne nezametnom, no na fiziologicheskom urovne on nepremenno proyavitsya.
'Moreover, it's about a deep, internal stress, externally unnoticeable, but it will certainly manifest itself on a physiological level.'

(296)
Vneshne nezametnyy, etot stress nepremenno proyavitsya.
'Externally unnoticeable, this stress will certainly manifest itself.'

Another group of examples is related to conjoined adjectives (participles):

(297)
(SinTagRus)
No ya by skazal, chto zvezdy - proshlyye i podrastayushchiye - v osnovnom doma ostalis'.
'But I would say that the stars – past and rising – mostly stayed home.'

(298)
Proshlyye i podrastayushchiye, vse zvezdy v osnovnom ostalis' doma.
'Past and rising, all the stars mostly stayed home.'

Constructions with ADs are permissible with any coordinating means, including asyndetic coordination:

(299)
(SinTagRus)
...chitatel', to yest' lyuboy myslyashchiy chelovek, ispytyvayet segodnya, kak mne kazhetsya, potrebnost' ne stol'ko v syuzhetnykh khitrospleteniyakh, skol'ko v iskrennem sobesednike, dumayushchem, vspominayushchem, perezhivayushchem vmeste s toboy…
'…the reader, that is, any thinking person, feels today, it seems to me, a need not so much for intricate plots, but for a sincere interlocutor, thinking, remembering, experiencing together with you…'

As mentioned earlier, all examples of ADs with expanded constituents (syntactic dependents or coordination) can remain grammatical even with a single adjective if they are accompanied by appropriate intonational emphasis:

(300)
Prichem rech' idet o glubinnom, vnutrennem stresse, nezametnom, no takom, kotoryy nepremenno proyavitsya.
'Moreover, it's about a deep, internal stress, unnoticeable, but one that will certainly manifest itself.'

(301)
Nezametnyy, etot stress nepremenno proyavitsya.
'Unnoticeable, this stress will certainly manifest itself.'

The constitutive property of ADs, it seems, is not the quantity and type of constituents, but the presence of intonational emphasis, primarily a pause separating the adjective from the rest of the material.

Let's list some types of constituents similar to ADs but different from them. Firstly, ADs are not nominal constructions with a pronoun as head, such as `my nyneshniye` 'we current', `vse vernuvshiyesya` 'all who returned', `oba provinivshikhsya` 'both culprits'… This can be concluded from the fact that there are no lexical restrictions on the noun phrase / head to which the AD refers – unlike the aforementioned constructions.

Due to differences in semantics and contexts of use, ADs are also not examples of sortal (`shalfei lekarstvennyy` 'medicinal sage', `shalfei krasnyy` 'red sage', `shalfei muskatnyy` 'nutmeg sage', `shalfei lugovoy` 'meadow sage') or predicative inversion (`Aktory - sushchestva khrupkiye` 'Actors are fragile beings'), see (Lyutikova 2012).

Intonationally – by the absence of a pause and additional stress – ADs differ from so-called afterthought constructions, discontinuous constituents in which elements of one constituent fall "inside" another:

(302)
(Kovtunova 2002: 123)
V sirenevatoy rykhloy temnote vyazkiye plavali golosa.
'In the lilac, loose darkness, viscous voices floated.'

ADs also differ from secondary predication. For example, instrumental marking of ADs is excluded; see also (Pereltsvaig 2007: 133) and the sources cited therein:

(303)
*Murlykali i koposhilis' snegiri, neobyknovennymi sredi moroza i snega.
'*The bullfinches purred and bustled, _unusual (INSTR)_ amidst the frost and snow.'

(304)
*Gromko razreklamirovannym, yego proyekt opirayetsya na ofitsial'nuyu ideologiyu.
'*Loudly advertised (INSTR), his project relies on the official ideology.'

ADs, therefore, represent a special type of constituent, whose nature we will try to define below.

When studying examples of ADs, another regularity related to them stands out: the head in the original constructions is extremely often a pronoun or a proper noun. The following four examples demonstrate pronominal heads in postposition and left dislocation:

(305)
(SinTagRus)
a. …myatuyu bumazhnuyu skatert' trogatel'no ukreplyayut na verevke bel'yevymi prishepkami, i na ney, stavshey ekranom, poyavlyayetsya fotografiya.
   '…they touchingly fix the crumpled paper tablecloth to the rope with clothespins, and on it, having become a screen, a photograph appears.'
b. Svyazyvat'sya ne khotelos', a to b ya tebya, takogo khrabrogo!..
   'I didn't want to get involved, or else I would have [dealt with] you, so brave!..'

(306)
(SinTagRus)
a. Rasstroyennyy, s polnym podnosom, on ushel za kulisy - i uvidel, chto tam uzhe zreyet skandal.
   'Upset, with a full tray, he went backstage - and saw that a scandal was already brewing there.'
b. Ustavshiye, oni tem ne meneye ne skryvali vostorga: ischerpav zapas verevok i kryuch'yev, oni doshli do glubiny 1680 metrov, ostanovivshis' pered nachalom novogo kolodtsa.
   'Tired, they nevertheless did not hide their delight: having exhausted their supply of ropes and hooks, they reached a depth of 1680 meters, stopping before the beginning of a new well.'

The examples below present proper nouns as heads in postpositive and left-dislocated ADs:

(307)
(SinTagRus)
a. V Yevrope Prokof'yevu rady, odnako Dyagilev, pomeshannyy na balete, stremitsya chut' li ne kazhdyy yego kontsert «podslastit'» kakim-nibud' stsenicheskim deystvom.
   'In Europe, Prokofiev is welcome, but Dyagilev, obsessed with ballet, tries to "sweeten" almost every one of his concerts with some kind of stage performance.'
b. No eto bylo tak neopredelenno, chto Glasha, roslaya, delovaya, rabotavshaya bukhgalterom na spichechnoy fabrike, predlozhila…
   'But it was so uncertain that Glasha, tall, businesslike, working as an accountant at a match factory, suggested…'

(308)
(V. Shalamov. "The Handwriting", 1964)
Gotovyy ko vsemu, bezrazlichnyy ko vsemu, Krist shel po uzkoy trope.
'Ready for anything, indifferent to everything, Christ walked along the narrow path.'

It appears that the (more than) regular use of pronouns / proper nouns indicates that the constituents to which ADs refer are always headed by a full noun phrase, not a head noun.

Within extended adjective phrases in ADs, the use of reflexive pronouns is possible. This applies not only to postpositive ADs but also to ADs with left dislocation:

Since reflexives are grammatical only in positions where they are c-commanded by their antecedent, it can be concluded that even with left dislocation, they are originally located within some constituent with their antecedent, which dominates and c-commands them.

Contrary to the assertion in (AG-80-2), an AD can refer not only to the subject but also to participants in other cases. Examples for the direct object are easily found, both with postposition and with left dislocation:

(311)
(SinTagRus)
I iskali, i nashli tam opyat' tol'ko sebya, opustoshennogo, robkogo i tumannogo, kak Andromeda v byustgaltere.
'And they searched, and found there again only themselves, devastated, timid, and hazy, like Andromeda in a bra.'

(312)
(Internet)
Ustavshego i ozyabshego, dyadya Borya vstretil menya so vsey dushevnoy teplotoy…
'Tired and chilled, Uncle Borya met me with all his heartfelt warmth…'

The situation is somewhat more complex with oblique case contexts. While examples of postpositive usage are easily found, cases of left dislocation were not encountered when searching for examples. When constructing left dislocation based on postposition examples, we get the following picture for the dative and instrumental:

(313)
(A. Dumas. "Isaac Laquedem")
V eto vremya umer Tsezar' Avgust, kotoryy dal peredyshku vsemu miru, ustavshemu ot pobed, zavoyevaniy, perevorotov i vsyakogo roda potryaseniy i nuzhdavshemusya v kratkom otdykhe…
'At this time, Caesar Augustus died, who gave a respite to the whole world, which was tired of victories, conquests, upheavals, and all kinds of turmoil, and needed a brief rest…'

(314)
??/* Ustavshemu ot pobed, Tsezar' Avgust dal peredyshku miru.
`??/*Tired of victories, Caesar Augustus gave the world a respite.'`

Spamery atakuyut domashniye komp'yutery, mnogiye iz kotorykh dazhe ne snabzheny bazovoy sistemoy zashchity firewall (sposobnoy obnaruzhivat' lyubyye vtorzheniya).
'Spammers attack home computers, many of which are not even equipped with a basic firewall protection system (capable of detecting any intrusions).'

(316)
*Sposobnoy obnaruzhivat' lyubyye vtorzheniya, komp'yutery snabzheny bazovoy sistemoy zashchity.
'*Capable of detecting any intrusions, computers are equipped with a basic protection system.'

Thus, left dislocation of ADs with oblique-cased participants is ungrammatical. An important fact for us will be that postpositive ADs are permissible in the context of the genitive and prepositional phrases:

(317)
(Internet)
a. Kazhdaya novaya stranitsa - kapel'ka reki udivitel'nogo mira, novogo i nevedomogo.
   'Every new page is a drop of the river of a wonderful world, new and unknown.'
b. …ostavim posle sebya grudu veshchey, starykh, no v rabochem sostoyanii.
   '…we will leave behind a pile of things, old, but in working condition.'

(318)
(SinTagRus)
Yesli kanal budet - znachit eto vse-taki udar lineynoy molnii, pust' neobychnoy, no lineynoy.
'If there's a channel – it means it's still a linear lightning strike, perhaps unusual, but linear.'

(319)
(SinTagRus)
...tikhiy, skoryy na svetlyye slezy, lyubitel' karamelek, izyuma, bulochek s varenyem, nichem ne byl on pokhozh na Loru, shumnyuyu, vzvolnovannuyu, vsyu cherno-zolotuyu.
'…quiet, quick to bright tears, a lover of caramels, raisins, buns with jam, he was in no way similar to Laura, noisy, agitated, all black and gold.'

Left dislocation in these cases is ungrammatical:

(320)
*Pust' neobychnoy, no lineynoy, eto vse-taki udar molnii.
'*Though unusual, but linear, this is still a lightning strike.'

(321)
*Shumnuyu, vzvolnovannuyu, papa ne byl pokhozh na Loru.
'*Noisy, agitated, Dad was not like Laura.'

Note that (postpositive) ADs differ from depictives in this respect. In both ADs and agreeing depictives, adjectives copy the gender, number, and case of the noun they refer to. Despite this, the grammaticality conditions of the two constructions are different: only ADs, but not agreeing depictives, are permissible in the context of the genitive and prepositional phrase. In the absence of the intonation characteristic of ADs, adjectives form depictives that are ungrammatical with a possessor or a prepositional phrase:

(322)
*My nablyudali udar molnii uzhe neyarkoy.
'*We observed the lightning strike already dim (FEM.GEN).'

(323)
*Papa ne byl pokhozh na Loru takuyu veseluyu.
'*Dad was not like Laura such a cheerful one.'

So, let's list the main properties of ADs that we have established: i) the noun phrase to which the AD refers is a full noun phrase; ii) in the initial configuration, such a full noun phrase c-commands the adjective phrase; iii) postpositive ADs can refer to noun phrases in direct and oblique cases, as well as in the context of the genitive and prepositional phrases; iv) ADs dislocated to the left periphery can refer only to noun phrases in direct cases; v) postpositive ADs, while similar to agreeing depictives in requiring the copying of grammatical features, differ in their possibility of use in genitive and prepositional contexts.

Based on these distributional properties, we propose the following approach to the structure of ADs. In (Heringa 2011), a special type of functional heads and their projections is posited. We believe that there is no need to introduce special functional projections. We propose that detached uses of adjectives are formed within nominal projections, on par with the so-called detached-attributive constructions (Sannikov 2010), which are noun phrases:

(324)
(Sannikov 2010: 118)
a. [DP On], [DP negodyay], pogubil svoyego ottsa.
   [DP He], [DP scoundrel], ruined his father.
b. [DP Negodyay], [DP on] pogubil svoyego ottsa.
   [DP Scoundrel], [DP he] ruined his father.

In such cases, two noun phrases are present. One of them, the "anchor" in (Heringa 2011) terminology, is the "subject," and the second is the predicate. As we see, (Sannikov 2010) examines the same usages that we have identified. In the first of these, the predicate is in postposition to the anchor, and in the second, it is dislocated to the absolute beginning. The ADs we have identified have the same structure as V. Z. Sannikov's "detached-attributive constructions," with the only difference being that the predicate is an adjective phrase rather than a noun phrase. In both cases, the "anchor-subject" is a full noun phrase and, at some stage of derivation, forms a single nominal constituent with the predicates (adjectives or noun phrases).

Note that constructions with detached (postpositive) noun phrases can also be embedded in the genitive or a prepositional phrase:

(325)
(M. Gorky. "An Evening at Panashkin's")
dvenadtsati let, posle smerti ottsa, p'yanogo chinovnika kazennoy palaty…
'twelve years old, after the death of his father, a drunk official of the treasury chamber…'

(326)
(Internet)
Tut yemu i prikhodit uvedomleniye, chto strana ot nego, negodyaya, nalog zhdet…
'Here he receives a notification that the country expects a tax from him, the scoundrel…'

Predicates – noun phrases ("detached-attributive constructions"), as well as predicates – adjective phrases, are located locally with their "anchor-subject." This allows the predicate to freely receive the case feature value simultaneously with the anchor. At least two types of structures could be proposed as candidates for the projection uniting the subject-anchor and the predicate. The first of these structures is a small clause, the second an extended projection of the subject noun phrase. We will adhere to the second approach, as it is more economical and (again) involves fewer assumptions.

We believe that AD-adjectives are formed by adjoining the adjective phrase to the maximal projection of the D level, DP. Being "external" to DP constituents, such adjuncts fall within the "scope" of the case feature along with their subject-anchor:

(327) Structure of appositive detachments in postposition

<!-- image -->

Left dislocation of ADs is derived from the postpositive phrase by raising the adjective phrase to the focus position. The ungrammaticality of all contexts except the subject and direct object may be related to the deeper embedding of noun phrases in oblique cases, which prevents the movement of ADs to the left periphery.

Such an analysis easily explains the ungrammaticality of SFs as appositive detachments, cf. `*Komp'yutery snabzheny sistemoy, sposobna obnaruzhivat' vtorzheniya.` '*Computers are equipped with a system, capable of detecting intrusions.' The reason for the ungrammaticality of SFs is the location of the appositive detachment within a nominal projection and, consequently, the necessity to express a case feature.

## 2.3.4. Summary: Adjectives and the Typology of Secondary Predication

We have discussed the structure of secondary predication and phenomena similar to it. The following facts appear important from the perspective of the theory and typology of adjectivity. Resultative secondary predications are always associated specifically with an adjectival projection. The interaction of the argument and event structure of the verb and the resultative testifies to the adjective's ability to introduce its own subject argument. Depictive secondary predications, as a rule, are characteristic of both nominal and adjectival projections. Russian agreeing depictives, however, can only be formed from adjectivals. Resultatives and depictives introduce states predicated of the adjectival's subject participant and are in some way related to the situation defined by the verb. In this, resultatives and depictives are contrasted with appositive detachments, which stem from nominal structures and can be organized as both adjectival and nominal projections. Finally, we noted that Russian does not permit resultative FFs and depictive SFs, as verbs in Russian cannot take adjectival complements. Depictive SFs are impossible because the state defined by the `res` head (SF) cannot be integrated into a temporal chain.

## 2.4. Syntax of the Comparative and the Structure of the Comparative Word Form

## 2.4.1. Restrictions on the Formation of the Morphological Degree of Comparison

In Russian, as in many other European languages, such as English, there are two ways of forming comparative constructions: morphological and analytical:

(328)
(From the works of A. P. Chekhov)
Pobeg vne Sibiri schitayetsya boleye vazhnym prestupleniyem i karayetsya strozhe, chem pobeg v Sibiri…
'Escape outside Siberia is considered a more serious crime and is punished more strictly than escape within Siberia…'

(329)
(From the works of N. G. Chernyshevsky)
No u kazhdogo iz nas… yest' poritsatel' boleye strogiy, chem sam Rakhmetov…
'But each of us… has a censor more strict than Rakhmetov himself…'

(330)
(From the works of A. Conan Doyle)
…nothing stranger than the result when viewed, for instance by Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard.
'And what could be more surprising than the conclusions that are easily drawn if one looks at things, say, from the perspective of Mr. Lestrade of Scotland Yard!'

(331)
(From the works of B. Stoker)
…more strange narrative… it has not been my lot to come across.
'A stranger narrative… it has not been my lot to come across before.'

In addition to both languages having morphological and analytical comparatives (hereinafter - MC and AC), they are also brought closer by a similarity in expressing the standard (object) of comparison. Both Russian and English use specialized complementizers for this function, `chem` and `than`, respectively.

As is known, English forms comparative and superlative degrees according to the following rule: in the case of monosyllabic adjectives and adjectives with an unstressed second syllable, the MC is used; for other adjectives, the AC is used, see, for example, (Matushansky 2002). However, such phonological restrictions are not absolute; exceptions are found both for supposed MC cases: `*iller`, `*apter`, `*irksomer` (with grammatical `handsomer`) (Bobaljik 2012: 164), and for some AC candidates: `easterlier` (easterly), `weevilier` (weevily).

Russian also demonstrates some phonological restrictions on the formation of the comparative degree. For example, there are certain restrictions on the formation of the MC related to accentuation. As stated in (Yeskova 2011: 138), a number of monosyllabic adjectives are unable to follow the general pattern of stress shift to the comparative suffix, cf. `vazhnyy - vazhnee` 'important - more important' vs. `vechnyy - *vechneye` 'eternal - *more eternal'.

Establishing the nature of phonological restrictions for Russian is sometimes as challenging as for English. For instance, the adjectives listed below ending in `-zh`, `-d`, `-g` show no visible differences in (morpho)phonological structure, yet they behave differently in comparative formation:

(332)
a. prigozhiy - prigozheye
   'handsome - handsomer'
b. pokhozhiy - *pokhozheye
   'similar - *more similar'
c. tverdyy - tverzhe
   'hard - harder'
d. gordyy - *gorzhe / *gordeye
   'proud - *prouder (incorrect form 1) / *prouder (incorrect form 2)'
e. strogiy - strozhe
   'strict - stricter'
f. ubogiy - *ubozhe
   'wretched - *more wretched'

It can be said, nevertheless, that phonological restrictions on the formation of Russian comparatives have been studied quite well; see primarily (Yeskova 2011), as well as (Brander 1999) et al. The influence of suffixation on the possibility of forming degrees of comparison, in other words, morphological restrictions, is of interest.

In A. A. Zaliznyak's Grammatical Dictionary (Zaliznyak 1980), a generally broad view is adopted regarding the ability of adjectives to form comparatives — the MC can be formed from any adjective, with broad classes of exceptions only for adjectivals with certain suffixes. Specifically, denominal suffixes `-sk` and `-in` regularly prevent the formation of the MC, see also (Yeskova 2011: 131), as do participial markers `-shch` and `-(v)sh` in cases where the lexeme formed with their help transitions from participles to adjectives.

As stated in (Yeskova 2011: 136): "From most suffixed qualitative adjectives, forms ending in `-eye` are formed with complete freedom." At the same time, according to N. A. Yeskova's observation: "The only suffixed class from which forms ending in `-eye` are not formed entirely freely are deverbal adjectives with the suffix `-l-`" (Ibid.: 137), see also (Yanko-Trinitskaya 1989: 68). The suffixes of passive participles `-enn` and `-ann` do not impose a prohibition on MC formation (Ibid.), and we would add that participles ending in `-m` also do not demonstrate a prohibition on MC formation.

The data from English generally resemble Russian – the prohibition on attaching the MC suffix to adjectival derivational markers, both denominal and deverbal, is perhaps even stricter here. Let's summarize the mentioned facts in the table, providing examples of suffixes that most regularly impede MC derivation:

(333) Morphological restrictions on MC formation

| derivatives | Russian                                                                                    | English                                                                   |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| from noun   | `* -sk, * -in: *utineye, *gigantskoye`                                                     | `* -al, * -ful, * -ic: *normaler, *useful(l)er, *basic(k)er`              |
| from verb   | `* -(v)sh, * -l, * -shch: *ustavsheye, *pozhileye, *podkhodyashcheye but: obizhenneye, lyubimeye` | `* -ed, * -ing: *tireder, *boringer`                                      |

We will show that, despite the apparent interchangeability of MC and AC in Russian, their structure and, consequently, their interpretation differ. One implication is this: for adjectives for which MC formation is impossible for one reason or another, the rules of usage and semantics of the analytical comparative form differ from the "basic" morphological strategy.

## 2.4.2. Morphological and Analytical Comparative

Let's discuss the distribution and internal syntax of two types of Russian comparative constructions. First, we will establish the main syntactic properties of MCs and ACs in Russian, see also (Yanko-Trinitskaya 1989: 65-68), then briefly describe the variants of comparative structure analysis proposed by previous researchers, after which we will examine the peculiarities of MC and AC distribution.

In a comparison situation (e.g., 'to be taller'), there are two main participants: the subject (who is taller) and the object of comparison (taller than whom). In addition, the differential³³ (by how much / how many times taller) and the parameter (taller at the withers, standing, …) can be expressed.

³³ Also a measure phrase, Measure Phrase.

Let's consider the possibility of using MCs and ACs in syntactic contexts characteristic of adjectives. Primarily, such a context is the position of the head of predication, where both MCs³⁴ and ACs can be used:

³⁴ The addition of the attenuative prefix `po-`, as far as we know, does not affect the distribution of MCs.

(334)
(From the works of S. T. Aksakov)
Varvara Mikhaylovna, kak zhenshchina, byla boleye lyubopytna, da i kharakterom pozhileye, chem yeyo suprug.
'Varvara Mikhailovna, as a woman, was more curious, and livelier in character, than her husband.'

(335)
(From the works of D. I. Pisarev)
V takiye minuty myortvyy dom byl nesravnenno prilichneye i blagorazumneye, chem bursa vo vremya rekreatsii.
'At such moments, the dead house was incomparably more decent and sensible than the seminary during recreation.'

(336)
(From the works of Andrey Bely)
...tol'ko A. S. i v opisyvayemoye vremya byl boleye odinokim, chem ya…
'...only A. S. was more lonely than I was during the described time…'

Note that the standard of comparison, expressed by the special conjunction `chem` 'than', is grammatical in Russian for both morphological and analytical comparatives.

The second syntactic function defining the category of the adjective (and to an even greater extent) is the function of an attribute. Here, the Russian language (unlike Old Russian) does not allow the use of MCs and permits only ACs:

(337)
(From the works of K. M. Stanyukovich)
a. Neskol'ko osunuvsheyesya, poblednevsheye litso i slegka vvalivshiyesya glaza, vsledstviye bessonnoy nochi, pridavali yemu yeshche boleye interesnyy vid.
   'His somewhat gaunt, pale face and slightly sunken eyes, due to a sleepless night, gave him an even more interesting appearance.'

(338)
- b. * Osunuvsheyesya litso i vvalivshiyesya glaza pridavali yemu interesneye vid.
   '*His gaunt face and sunken eyes gave him a more interesting (uninflected MC) look.'

(340) (From the works of A. F. Pisemsky)
a. … yego voobshche schitali v obshchestve boleye umnym chelovekom, chem on byl na samom dele!
   '…he was generally considered in society a smarter person than he really was!'
b. * Yego schitali umneye chelovekom, chem on byl na samom dele.
   '*He was considered a smarter (uninflected MC) person than he really was.'

Meanwhile, MCs, as well as ACs, are permissible within a noun phrase in postposition to the noun:

(339) (From the works of Andrey Bely)
Ya eshche ne vstrechal cheloveka umneye sebya.
'I have never met a person smarter than myself.'

(340) (From the works of M. Yu. Lermontov)
Izvinite -no mozhet byt', ona nashla cheloveka eshche dostoyneye vas…
'Excuse me - but perhaps she found a person even more worthy than you…'

(341) (From the works of F. M. Dostoyevsky)
Ya nikogda v zhizni ne vstrechal cheloveka boleye zastenchivogo…
'I have never in my life met a more shy person…'

(342) (From the works of A. F. Pisemsky)
Cheloveka boleye dostoynogo dlya etogo trudno bylo i nayti…
'It was difficult to find a more worthy person for this…'

The prohibition on prepositive uses in noun phrases for MCs is related not to their syntactic category itself, but to the fact that MCs are unable to agree with the head noun. Indeclinable adjectives like `bezh` 'beige', `klesh` 'flared', `netto` 'net', `komil'fo` 'comme il faut' show a similar distribution – they appear in predicative position, as well as within a noun phrase in postposition to the head, cf. `Kupila bryuki bezh, tsvet kak na kartinke, tkan' tonkaya` (Internet) 'She bought beige trousers, the color as in the picture, the fabric thin', etc.

In English, where adjectives do not require attributive agreement, there is no prohibition on placing MCs in preposition to the head noun:

(343) English (From the works of Ch. Dickens)
As to understanding him, you are [a cleverer fellow] than most of us, Daisy, if you can do that.
'As for understanding him, if you managed to grasp it, dear Daisy, you would be wiser than many of us.'

(344) (From the works of G. Eliot)
…I advise you to put by the 'History of the Devil,' and read [some prettier book].
'…I advise you to put aside "The History of the Devil" and read some other, good books.'

Let's discuss one difference important to us in the properties of the morphological and analytical comparative, related to their semantics. In the literature dedicated to the analysis of degrees of comparison, the asymmetry between the comparative and the inherent semantics of the adjective has long been discussed. According to Mel'chuk, this observation goes back to Sapir (cf. Mel'chuk 1998: 117), and it states the following. For most adjectives denoting gradable properties, the comparative does not carry the presupposition of the presence of the quality expressed by the adjective's original positive form. Thus, in the examples below, Dmitry might not have been young, and the neck is by no means necessarily short (moreover, the opposite is explicitly stated):

(345) (From the works of I. S. Turgenev)
… nastoyashchiy Dimitriy byl by gorazdo molozhe, chem kazalsya Lzhedimitriy…
'…the real Dmitry would have been much younger than the False Dmitry appeared…'

(346) (From the works of S. T. Aksakov)
… sheya dlinnaya, no koroche, chem u gagary…
'…the neck is long, but shorter than a loon's…'

Note that by no means all adjectives behave this way; from the example below, it most likely follows that the layer was indeed bright and beautiful:

(347) (From the works of V. K. Arsenyev)
Perlamutrovyy sloy byl gorazdo yarche i krasiveye, chem sam zhemchug.
'The mother-of-pearl layer was much brighter and more beautiful than the pearl itself.'

Those adjectives that do not have an obligatory implication of possessing the property in the comparative degree (which, it seems, constitute the majority) will be of interest to us due to the following contrast. The AC, unlike the MC, necessarily implies the presence of the property conveyed by the positive degree, cf. (Mel'chuk 1998: 123; Vorotnikov 1999). If the examples above contain an explicit negation of the property's presence, they will be incorrect with the AC:

(348) # Nastoyashchiy Dimitriy byl starym, no vse-taki boleye molodym, chem Lzhedimitriy…
   '#The real Dmitry was old, but still younger than the False Dmitry…'
(349) # … sheya dlinnaya, no boleye korotkaya, chem u gagary…
   '#…the neck is long, but shorter than a loon's…'

We get the same effect of pragmatic infelicity in cases where the compared objects are correctly located on the scale defined by the adjective, but do not possess the given quality outside the comparison context:

(350) # Begemot boleye legkiy, chem slon.
   '#The hippopotamus is lighter than the elephant.'
(351) # Slon boleye nizkiy, chem zhiraf.
   '#The elephant is shorter than the giraffe.'

Both examples become acceptable in the MC form:

(352) Begemot legche slona.
   'The hippopotamus is lighter than the elephant.'
(353) Slon nizhe zhirafa.
   'The elephant is shorter than the giraffe.'

The strangeness of the examples with AC is explained precisely by the fact that only in this case, but not with MC, there is a presupposition of possessing the quality. The demonstrated semantic difference between AC and MC, where AC combines with the positive degree of the adjective and is contrasted with MC, unexpectedly correlates with the use of AC and MC in the attributive function, which is grammatical for the analytical comparative and ungrammatical for the morphological comparative.

## 2.4.3. Approaches to the Structure of the Comparative

The syntax and semantics of the comparative have repeatedly been described in terms of modern generative grammar, see (Pulman 1991; Heim 2000; Kennedy 1998; 1999; 2000; 2009; Bhatt, Pancheva 2004; 2007; Matushansky 2013; Morzycki 2015) et al. for English, Japanese, and Slavic languages. As for Russian, one can mention the works of (Matushansky 2002; Ionin, Matushansky 2013; Grashchenkov 2008).

In (Matushansky 2008a), a conclusion is drawn that will also be important for the analysis of the comparative: the syntax of the superlative degree (including in Russian) reduces to the attributive use of the adjective. Observations regarding the derivational link between deadjectival verbs and their derivational bases are also interesting – as shown with material from many languages, such verbs derive specifically from the comparative / superlative, and not from the positive degree of adjectives, see, for example, (Bobaljik 2007) et al.

As argued in (Matushansky 2013), the morphological comparative can be derived by successive movement of the lexical head of the adjective to a position where it combines with the comparative marker located above it in the structure, see (Abney 1987: 213):

(354) Structure of the comparative according to (Abney 1987)

<!-- image -->

Possible objections to this approach are related to the fact that in English, the choice between MC and AC is based on phonological properties – already at the level of combining morphemes (the adjective stem and the comparative marker), it is necessary to know the phonological shape of the stem. This contradicts the approach to comparative formation as an exclusively syntactic process – the phonological component must "receive as input" a ready syntactic structure.

To "save" the syntactic approach to comparative derivation, the rule of Local Dislocation was introduced. In the article (Embick, Noyer 2001), it was proposed that the adjective stem undergoes a post-syntactic operation of Local Dislocation: comparative / superlative markers, located locally with the adjective stem, "check" whether it satisfies phonological restrictions. If yes, MC is used; if no, AC is used. Such an operation is called dislocation because it actually corresponds to a morphological "lowering" operation (Lowering) of an element in the structure, characteristic of morphology³⁵ and not inherent to syntax. If any element appears between the comparative / superlative marker during the derivation process, a variant is chosen that does not morphologically correspond to the word form but satisfies the local context (AC):

³⁵ Local dislocation is an operation in the spirit of Affix hopping, where the third-person singular verbal inflection "lowers" and is incorporated into the verb from a position higher than the verb word form.

(355) (Embick, Noyer 2001: 565)
a. Mary is the most amazingly smart person…
b. * Mary is the amazingly smart-est person…
'Mary is the smartest person' (lit.: '#Mary is the most amazingly smart woman')

The operation of Local Dislocation, however, is incompatible with facts of suppletion. According to it, the phonological form must be chosen before the stem and affix combine, which makes the existence of suppletive degrees of comparison impossible (`plokhoy - khuzhe / khudshiy` 'bad - worse / worst', `khoroshiy - luchshe / luchshiy` 'good - better / best'; `bad - worse / worst`, `good - better / best`, etc.), see (Bobaljik 2012; Matushansky 2013).

Indeed, it is generally accepted that the comparative morpheme occupies a higher position than the adjective stem. The following arguments from (Bhatt, Pancheva 2004) can be presented. Firstly, the comparative marker has a "valency" specifically for a clause headed by a particular complementizer. As shown by

the following examples, `than` is used in comparison, while `as` is used in equative constructions:

(356) English
(Bhatt, Pancheva 2004: 3)
a. David is less worried than *as / *that Monica is.
   'David is less worried than Monica is.'
b. Anastasia is as tall as / *than / *that Daniel is.
   'Anastasia is as tall as Daniel is.'

Secondly, semantically, the comparative compares the degree of manifestation of a certain quality (`John is tall`) with a standard (`than 6 feet`). The logical form for `John is taller than 6 feet` 'John is taller than 6 feet' looks like this:

(357) English
(Bhatt, Pancheva 2004: 4)
[DegP -er than 6 feet] t₁ John is [AP t₁ tall]

If the comparative is located higher in the structure than the adjective stem, then in English, by the time Local Dislocation applies, both morphemes, the stem and the comparative marker, have already entered the derivation, and it is impossible to choose a suppletive form. Anticipating a bit, we will say that such a problem will not arise if MC and AC correspond to different syntactic structures – which we will ultimately try to show. In works dedicated to the syntax of the comparative, a distinction between MC and AC structures is usually not made, see, for example, (Matushansky 2002; Embick 2007).

Another interesting observation is related to suppletive forms. As stated in (Matushansky 2013), following (Bobaljik 2012), suppletive forms in the world's languages are represented as follows:

(358) (Matushansky 2013: 61)
a. intelligent → more / most intelligent
b. cute → cuter / cutest
c. * wuggal → more / most galliwug
d. good → better, best

The only situation not attested in the world's languages is the (unattested) hypothetical case (c), where suppletive forms arise with the analytical method of formation. Matushansky concludes from this that morphological forms are "assembled" into a single word form at the syntactic level and before phonology, which should distinguish them from analytical constructions.

The most complete formal analysis of the Russian comparative is presented in (Matushansky 2002). According to Matushansky, the structure of MC and AC is identical. The comparative is formed in syntax, using the head movement operation³⁶. The comparative word `boleye` 'more', according to (Matushansky 2002), replaces the morphological marker `-(y)e` when the stem cannot attach it for various reasons. The comparative markers (`-(y)e` / `boleye`) fill the Deg node of the corresponding functional projection, which takes the adjective phrase as its complement, and places the differential (by how much / how many times) in the specifier:

(359) Structure of the Russian comparative according to (Matushansky 2002)

<!-- image -->

³⁶ Head movement, a syntactic process according to Matushansky's views.

Such an analysis does not explain the two differences we mentioned between MC and AC – the mismatch in their semantic properties and the impossibility of attributive use of MC. Matushansky explains the ungrammaticality of attributive MCs by the absence of agreement features on the comparative phrase. The grammaticality of English attributive MCs follows from the fact that English noun phrases with adjectives are entirely devoid of agreement features, which distinguishes them from Russian attributive constructions. Nevertheless, a uniform analysis of MC and AC does not allow for an explanation of the grammaticality of attributive ACs. If the Deg head is always devoid of agreement features for gender, number, and case, the presence of such features on a lower A(dj) head will not save the derivation, as it is Deg that determines the distributional properties of the comparative in the "external" syntactic context.

Another solution that raises questions is that the complement of the comparative Deg phrase syntactically depends on the adjective in the structure presented above. In (Ionin, Matushansky 2013), a different structure is presented, where the object of comparison already depends on Deg:

## 2.4.4. Syntactic Structure of the Comparative in Russian

Our proposed approach is as follows. The structures underlying MC and AC in Russian are different. The morphological comparative is formed with the participation of the Deg head, while the analytical comparative is projected by a "regular" adjective phrase. The Deg head is "built upon" the adjective stem and is devoid of agreement features for gender, number, and case, which is why the attributive use of MC is ungrammatical:

(361) Structure of MC (first approximation)

<!-- image -->

When forming the phrase `vkusneye, chem grushi` 'tastier than pears', the adjective stem raises from the Adj position to the head of the comparative phrase, where the `-(y)e` inflection is located.

The derivation of AC proceeds differently. They are formed as SFs of adjectives, taking as an adjunct an Int group headed by the comparative word `boleye` 'more'.

(362) Structure of AC (first approximation)

<!-- image -->

Such a structure has at least two advantages. Firstly, the IntP head `boleye` syntactically behaves like intensifiers such as `ochen'` 'very', `sovsem` 'completely', `slishkom` 'too', etc. Secondly, the possibility of attributive use of AC follows automatically – they are nothing more than SFs of adjectives, which possess gender, number, and case features.

The observation about the absence of agreement features in the comparative degree is well-known, see (AG-80-1: § 1342): "The comparative degree form has no morphological meanings of gender, number, and case, and belongs to the morphological category of indeclinable words." Our proposed approach "localizes" these features in the syntactic structure – they are present in the agreement projection AdjP and absent in the Deg projection, the construction of which occurs in the absence of Adj.

The difference in structure also explains the semantic distinctions between MC and AC. The semantics of AC compositionally derives from the semantics of the positive degree of the adjective and what the comparative adverbs `boleye` 'more' / `meneye` 'less' contribute. The MC semantically differs from the positive degree of the adjective because it is formed by different rules.

The differences in the semantics of MC and AC correlate with the distinction proposed in (Kennedy 2009) between so-called explicit and implicit comparison. In the case of explicit comparison, both objects are compared in terms of their attainment of a certain degree of manifestation of a property. It doesn't matter whether the hippopotamus and the elephant are light; what matters is that the degree of lightness of the hippopotamus is greater than the degree of lightness of the elephant. In the case of implicit comparison, it is determined to what extent each object possesses the quality defined by the positive degree of the adjective. In other words, it is established whether the lightness of the hippopotamus surpasses the lightness of the elephant. As can be understood, MC corresponds to explicit comparison, while AC corresponds to implicit comparison, which follows from our proposed syntactic structure: MC is a projection of a comparative head, while AC is a "regular" projection of an adjective.

A feature uniting both types of Russian comparatives is the ability of MC and AC to specify the object of comparison, which distinguishes the comparative degree from the positive (cf.: `*Yabloki byli vkusnyye chem grushi` '*Apples were tasty than pears'). In both cases, the comparative markers are responsible for the participants in the comparison situation: MC places the object of comparison in the specifier, and the lexical heads `boleye` 'more' / `meneye` 'less' in the complement.

Confirmation of the correctness of our approach comes from frequently encountered cases of simultaneous use of analytical and morphological comparative means: `#boleye luchshe` '#more better', `#boleye interesney` '#more more interesting', etc. Such examples are not ungrammatical structurally – their formation is not only permissible but regularly observed. The reason for their incorrectness is that the simultaneous use of two comparative markers is semantically redundant. In the syntactic structure, however, `boleye` 'more' and `-(y)e` occupy different positions, which allows speakers to generate such examples.

Below, we will discuss some other properties of MCs and ACs, after which we will propose a final version of the analysis.

## 2.4.5. Comparative from Non-Gradable Adjectives

As is known, not only gradable adjectives can form degrees of comparison. Cases where non-gradable adjectives acquire a gradable meaning as a result of a semantic shift and become able to form MCs are well-described in the literature: "Comparative degree forms with morphemes `-eye` and `-ey` are also formed from relational adjectives in qualitative meanings: `dushevneye` 'more soulful', `muzykal'neye` 'more musical', `teatral'neye` 'more theatrical'" (AG-80-1: § 1343). N. A. Yeskova also notes the permissibility of forming degrees of comparison from relational adjectives when their semantics change, citing such examples from Russian prose as `traktirneye` 'more tavern-like', `zhivotney` 'more animal-like', `mramorneye` 'more marble-like', `rubinney` 'more ruby-like', `izumrudney` 'more emerald-like', `pepel'ney` 'more ash-like', etc., see (Yeskova 2011: 143).

In formal linguistics, it is common to speak of so-called coercion or semantic shift. With coercion, the formation of not only the morphological but also the analytical comparative is permissible:

(363) (From the works of I. F. Annensky)
Chto mozhet byt' boleye russkim, chem etot vechnyy kirpichnyy zavod, eto spasitel'noye zavtra…
'What could be more Russian than this eternal brick factory, this saving tomorrow…'

(364) (From the works of V. G. Belinsky)
… pod perom Batyushkova eta poema yavilas' boleye grecheskoyu, chem v originale.
'…under Batyushkov's pen, this poem appeared more Greek than in the original.'

(365) (From the works of L. N. Andreyev)
… samomu sebe kazalsya uzhasnym, neveroyatnym, boleye greshnym i buntuyushchim, chem yesli by kazhdyy den' rezal po cheloveku…
'…he seemed to himself terrible, unbelievable, more sinful and rebellious than if he cut a person every day…'

(366) (From the works of P. D. Boborykin)
Sanya otvedala i ternovki, meneye sladkoy i boleye vyazhushchey, chem slivyanka, ochen' krepkoy.
'Sanya tasted the sloe berry liquor, less sweet and more astringent than the plum liquor, very strong.'

In these examples, AC is formed from adjectives with suffixes `-sk` and `-shch`, which, as we indicated above, block MC formation: `*russkeye` '*more Russian', `*grecheskeye` '*more Greek', `*buntuyushcheye` '*more rebellious', `*vyazhushcheye` '*more astringent'. Nevertheless, the comparison situation becomes semantically permissible in cases of coercion, as shown by the examples above.

In connection with the prohibition on comparative formation from adjectives with suffixes like `-sk`, the following observation is also noteworthy. A number of Russian adjectives have two derivational variants: one with `-sk`, the other with `-n`, which also differ in their ability to form MCs:

| (367)       | *prakticheskoye 'more practical' (from -sk)   | vs.   | praktichneye 'more practical' (from -n)   |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
|             | *komicheskoye 'more comical' (from -sk)       | vs.   | komichneye 'more comical' (from -n)       |
|             | *istericheskoye 'more hysterical' (from -sk) | vs.   | isterichneye 'more hysterical' (from -n) |
|             | *tragicheskoye 'more tragic' (from -sk)       | vs.   | tragichneye 'more tragic' (from -n)       |

Such examples indicate that it is the suffix, and not the stem, that is responsible for blocking MC derivation.

As it seems to us, the impermissibility of MC and the grammaticality of AC in such cases is further evidence of the difference in the syntactic derivation of the two types of comparative. The analytical comparative, according to our approach, is formed by the same rules as SFs of adjectives, which is why the derivation of AC is not blocked.

The mechanism of semantic shift, when it occurs (AC `boleye russkiy` 'more Russian', MC `muzykal'neye` 'more musical'), is as follows. A "normal" gradable property defines a scale with different values: from less high to more high, etc. When using gradable adjectives, the speaker evaluates an object as occupying a certain place on such a scale.

At the same time, adjectives like `russkiy` 'Russian' or `muzykal'nyy` 'musical' merely categorize an object, relating it to a specific aspect of extralinguistic reality. In noun phrases like `russkaya kukhnya` 'Russian cuisine', `muzykal'nyy kritik` 'music critic', objects are defined by the intersection of the denotations of the lexemes 'Russian' and 'musical' with 'cuisine' and 'critic' respectively. When adjectives like `russkiy` or `muzykal'nyy` enter the syntactic context of a comparative construction, the objects they define are unable to manifest the property 'Russian' or 'musical' to a greater or lesser degree. Instead, the comparison shifts to certain mental representations of objects, as more or less coinciding with a prototype. Thus, mental operations of comparison and evaluation in the case of semantic shift are no longer associated with determining a point on the scale of a gradable property, but with evaluating the object's closeness to a prototype, some exemplary representative of objects of that class. In other words, we move from operations on denotational meaning (`russkaya kukhnya` 'Russian cuisine', `muzykal'nyy kritik` 'music critic') to operations on the significate (`boleye russkiy` 'more Russian', `muzykal'neye` 'more musical').

The fact that comparison in such cases occurs not between different degrees of manifestation of a property, but between representations of the object, is sometimes evident from examples:

(368) (From the works of V. G. Belinsky)
Donskiye kazach'i pesni mozhno prichislit' k tsiklu istoricheskikh, -i oni v samom dele boleye zasluzhivayut nazvaniye istoricheskikh, chem sobstvenno tak nazyvayemyye istoricheskiye russkiye narodnyye pesni.
'Don Cossack songs can be attributed to the cycle of historical songs, - and they indeed more deserve the name of historical songs than the so-called historical Russian folk songs themselves.'

Here, `boleye zasluzhivayut nazvaniye istoricheskikh` 'more deserve the name of historical' precisely describes the mental procedure of evaluating songs as being more or less similar to historical ones.

So what prevents the formation of MCs in cases like `*grecheskeye` '*more Greek', `*buntuyushcheye` '*more rebellious', etc.? As it seems to us, in this case, the prohibition on combining with certain suffixes is demonstrated precisely by the Deg head – similar to the `res` head of SFs. The combinatory properties of this head do not allow it to take as complements those syntactic units whose category does not satisfy the restrictions imposed by it. Just as transitive verbs take

as complements only projections headed by nouns – noun phrases – the Deg head "has valency" only for units of the Adj category (adjectives). Such a category can be inherent to a lexeme (`bystryy` 'fast', `zloy` 'evil', …) or be assigned by derivational suffixes that "erase" information about the categorical affiliation of the original stem (`umnyy` 'smart', `zlobnyy` 'malicious', …).

The adjective suffixes that do not allow comparative formation (`-sk`, `-in`, `-(v)sh`, `-l`, `-shch`, …), as we have hypothesized, are associated with the categorical feature Atr, not Adj. Attributives, therefore, do not satisfy the combinatory properties of the Deg head.

## 2.4.6. Standard of Comparison

In our proposed analysis, the standard of comparison, introduced by the conjunction `chem` 'than', is located in the structure of both types of comparative above the adjective. This contradicts the usual use of MC and AC, which presumes postposition of the standard:

(369) (From the works of A. P. Chekhov)
… eta mekhanicheskaya, kropotlivaya rabota kazalas' yemu interesneye, chem chteniye.
'…this mechanical, laborious work seemed more interesting to him than reading.'

(370) (From the works of L. N. Andreyev)
… eto drevneye pervichnoye naslazhdeniye ubivat' lyudey - umnykh, khitrykh, lukavykh, neizmerimo boleye interesnykh, chem samyye khishchnyye zveri.
'…this ancient primary pleasure of killing people – smart, cunning, sly, immeasurably more interesting than the most predatory animals.'

(371) (From the works of N. S. Leskov)
… ikh bylo tak mnogo, chto oni stanovilis' dlya menya strashneye, chem sobaki…
'…there were so many of them that they became scarier to me than dogs…'

(372) (From the works of V. Ya. Bryusov)
… i eto byl ad, boleye strashnyy, chem tot, kotoryy yavlen byl vzoram Dante Alighieri.
'…and it was a hell more terrifying than the one that was revealed to the gaze of Dante Alighieri.'

One can assume the following two options for achieving surface word order. Firstly, one can assume the movement of the adjective to some head dominating it, i.e., a linearization process. It seems that this option is more suitable for MCs, which turn out to be ungrammatical when the standard of comparison precedes the adjective:

(373) * Eta mekhanicheskaya rabota kazalas' yemu chem chteniye interesneye.
   '*This mechanical work seemed to him than reading more interesting.'
(374) * Oni stanovilis' chem sobaki strashneye dlya menya.
   '*They became than dogs scarier to me.'

AC, though rarely, allows the standard to precede it:

(375) (From the works of M. Yu. Lermontov)
… prosil u neye, slaboy devushki, u neye, yeshche boleye, chem on, bezzashchitnoy, sozhaleniya…
'…he asked her, a weak girl, her, even more defenseless than him, for pity…'

(376) (Internet)
… on byl gorazdo boleye, chem ya, sklonen k filosofii.
'…he was much more, than I, inclined to philosophy.'

We are inclined to believe that the (almost obligatory) postposition of the standard in the case of ACs is caused by the so-called rightward shift of "heavy" constituents. We will encounter an analogous linearization shift in Chapter 3 in connection with the attributive use of governed adjectives in English (`a difficult book [for anyone to read]` - 'a book difficult for anyone to read').

The fact that the linearization of the object of comparison is not always obligatory suggests that its nature is not (exclusively) syntactic. The high frequency of constructions with postposition is explained by the fact that the constituent introduced by the conjunction `chem` 'than' is a clause that can contain a considerable amount of structure.

The approach to the rightward placement of the `chem` 'than' comparison standard is also supported by examples where the `chem`-phrase and the comparative do not form a single constituent:

(377) (From the works of L. N. Andreyev)
… on vsegda byl mne simpatchen, i [[AdjP boleye blizkikh] druzey], [chem on], ya nikogda ne imel.
'…he was always sympathetic to me, and [[closer] friends], [than him], I never had.'

(378) (From the works of I. F. Annensky)
… eto [[AdjP boleye yavnaya] igra] dazhe, [chem ta]…
'…this is even a [[more obvious] game], [than that one]…'

It can thus be assumed that the rightward placement of the standard of comparison is the result of a post-syntactic operation of heavy material displacement.

The standard of comparison in Russian can also be expressed by a noun phrase in the genitive: "The comparative strongly governs informatively replenishing forms: Gen. case: `deshevle, dorozhe chego-n.` 'cheaper, more expensive than something', `boleye, meneye, vyshe, nizhe chego-n.` 'more, less, higher, lower than something', `vyshe normy` 'above norm', `bystreye vsekh` 'faster than everyone', `starshe brata` 'older than brother', `sil'neye smerti` 'stronger than death'…" (AG-80-2: § 1875).

Let's consider the following examples:

(379) (From the works of V. G. Belinsky)
Dlya chego, naprimer, zastavil on knyazya, dlya kotorogo… vkusnyy stol vsegda byl dorozhe zheny i yeyo chesti…
'Why, for example, did he make the prince, for whom… a tasty table was always dearer than his wife and her honor…'

(380) (From the works of V. G. Belinsky)
No proza togda byla vazhneye stikhov…
'But prose was then more important than poetry…'

Both adjectives, `dorogoy` 'dear' and `vazhnyy` 'important', can specify a participant in the dative or genitive with the preposition `dlya` 'for' (`dorog komu-to / dlya kogo-to` 'dear to someone / for someone', `vazhen komu-to / dlya kogo-to` 'important to someone / for someone'). In cases where the genitive standard and the lexical dependent are expressed simultaneously, only contiguous placement of the adjective and the standard of comparison is possible, and the order adjective - lexical dependent - standard of comparison is not possible:

(381) Vkusnyy stol byl dlya knyazya dorozhe zheny.
   'The tasty table was dearer to the prince than his wife.'
Vkusnyy stol byl dorozhe zheny dlya knyazya.
   'The tasty table was dearer than his wife to the prince.'
* Vkusnyy stol byl dorozhe dlya knyazya zheny.
   '*The tasty table was dearer to the prince than his wife.'

(382) Proza byla dlya chitatelya vazhneye stikhov.
   'Prose was more important to the reader than poetry.'
Proza byla vazhneye stikhov dlya chitatelya.
   'Prose was more important than poetry to the reader.'
* Proza byla vazhneye dlya chitatelya stikhov.
   '*Prose was more important to the reader than poetry.'

The requirement for contiguous juxtaposition of the adjective and the standard of comparison confirms the analysis proposed above. The genitive standard is generated in the specifier of the Deg projection, where it is assigned a case feature³⁷. As we hypothesized above, after the standard of comparison enters the DegP projection and is assigned the genitive case feature, the adjective moves to some head (let's define it as `deg`), directly dominating DegP. The surface word order, therefore, is the result of several head movements:

(383) Structure of MC after adjective movement

<!-- image -->

³⁷ Cf., however, (Bailyn 2004), where the standard is located in the complement position and receives the genitive from some universal Q projection.

Unlike MC, a genitive standard of comparison with AC is ungrammatical, see also (Yanko-Trinitskaya 1989: 65, 67):

(384) * Dlya knyazya vkusnyy stol byl boleye dorog / dorogoy / dorogim zheny.
   '*For the prince, the tasty table was dearer (short / long / instrumental) than his wife.'
(385) * No proza togda byla boleye vazhna / vazhnaya / vazhnoy stikhov.
   '*But prose was then more important (short / long / instrumental) than poetry.'

We assume that the differences in the structural position of the standard of comparison for MC and AC are responsible for this. In the case of MC, the standard is located in the specifier of the Deg head, which has the property of assigning genitive case. In the case of AC, the standard occupies the complement position of the comparative word-intensifier `boleye` 'more'.

The rules for the arrangement of the lexical dependent and the standard in ACs, however, are the same as for MCs:

(386) (From the works of I. F. Annensky)
Soderzhaniye samogo tipa Oblomova bogache Gogolevskikh prototipov, i ot etogo on gorazdo boleye pokhozh na nastoyashchego cheloveka, chem kazhdyy iz nikh.
'The content of the character Oblomov himself is richer than Gogol's prototypes, and because of this, he is much more like a real person than each of them.'

(387) (From the works of L. N. Andreyev)
Yesli by on god provalyalsya v mogile, on vernulsya by boleye pokhozhim na sebya, chem teper'.
'If he had spent a year lying in the grave, he would have returned more like himself than now.'

The order `chem`-comparative-dependent appears ungrammatical:

(388) * On gorazdo boleye pokhozh, chem kazhdyy iz nikh, na nastoyashchego cheloveka.
   '*He is much more like, than each of them, a real person.'
(389) * On byl by boleye pokhozhim, chem teper', na sebya.
   '*He would be more like, than now, himself.'

The reason for ungrammaticality here, however, is different: the `chem`-comparative is a constituent at the predicative level where ellipsis of identical material occurs:

(390) On gorazdo boleye pokhozh na nastoyashchego cheloveka, chem kazhdyy iz nikh [pokhozh na nastoyashchego cheloveka].
   'He is much more like a real person than each of them [is like a real person].'
(391) On byl by boleye pokhozhim na sebya, chem teper' [on byl pokhozhim na sebya].
   'He would be more like himself than now [he was like himself].'

If the lexical dependents [`na nastoyashchego cheloveka` 'like a real person'; `na sebya` 'like himself'] are located after the `chem`-comparative, they cannot be included in the material eliminated during ellipsis.

## 2.4.7. Differential

Finally, another regular attribute of a comparison situation is the so-called differential – an indication of by how many units or by how many times the manifestation of a property in one object exceeds its manifestation in another:

(392) (From the works of A. A. Blok)
On na tseluyu golovu vyshe drugikh, khodit tyazheloy postup'yu i smotrit tol'ko na Fainu.
'He is a whole head taller than others, walks with a heavy gait, and looks only at Faina.'

(393) (From the collective of authors. On the Volkhov Front)
Marshrut zheleznodorozhnykh perevozok s odnogo kryla na drugoye po etim rokadam stal koroche na 432 km…
'The route for railway transport from one flank to another along these bypasses became shorter by 432 km…'

However, the differential with the preposition `na` 'by' and the accusative case is ungrammatical with AC:

(394) * On na tseluyu golovu boleye vysokiy.
   '*He is a whole head more tall.'
(395) * Marshrut stal boleye korotkim na 5 km.
   '*The route became more short by 5 km.'

An explanation for this semantic effect can be found in (Kennedy 2009). As we have already established, MC corresponds to so-called explicit comparison, and AC to implicit comparison. According to Kennedy, one of the properties of implicit comparison is precisely its incompatibility with the differential – this has been established based on material from various languages and is explained as follows. Since prepositional phrases with `na X yedinits` 'by X units' contain indications of absolute values, they are no longer context-dependent, and such dependence is a characteristic property of implicit comparison.

At the same time, both MC and AC can be used, for example, with the prepositional phrase `v X raz` 'X times':

(396) (From the works of A. P. Chekhov)
Yego zhenili rano, kogda on byl eshche studentom vtorogo kursa, i teper' zhena kazalas' v poltora raza starshe yego.
'They married him early, when he was still a second-year student, and now his wife seemed one and a half times older than him.'

(397) (From the works of V. K. Arsenyev)
Spusk na Aokhobe v dva raza dlinneye, chem pod'yom so storony Tyutikhe.
'The descent to Aokhobe is two times longer than the ascent from the Tyutikhe side.'

(398) (From the works of L. N. Tolstoy)
Veroyatno v desyat' raz starshe berez, sostavlyavshikh les, on byl v desyat' raz tolshche i v dva raza vyshe kazhdoy berezy.
'Probably ten times older than the birches that formed the forest, he was ten times thicker and two times taller than each birch.'

(399) (From the works of Andrey Bely)
… ne boyas' v pyat' raz boleye strogogo po trebovaniyam A. S. Vladimirskogo…
'…not fearing A. S. Vladimirsky, who was five times more strict in his demands…'

(400) (From the works of P. Ya. Chaadayev)
… divnoye sozvuchiye, v tysyachu raz boleye velichestvennoye, chem vse garmonii fizicheskogo mira.
'…a wondrous consonance, a thousand times more majestic than all harmonies of the physical world.'

Intensifiers like `namnogo` 'much', `gorazdo` 'far', etc., are also regularly used as differentials:

(401) (From the works of I. F. Annensky)
Soderzhaniye samogo tipa Oblomova bogache Gogolevskikh prototipov, i ot etogo on gorazdo boleye pokhozh na nastoyashchego cheloveka, chem kazhdyy iz nikh.
'The content of the character Oblomov himself is richer than Gogol's prototypes, and because of this, he is much more like a real person than each of them.'

As it seems to us, the differential, not being a strong syntactic participant in the comparison situation, occupies an adjunct position in both types of comparative ((402) and (403)):

(402) Structure of MC in the sentence `Yablonya [na 1 metr vyshe grushi].` 'The apple tree is [1 meter taller than the pear tree].'
<!-- image -->

(403) Structure of AC in the sentence `Yablonya [gorazdo boleye vysokaya, chem grusha].` 'The apple tree is [much taller than the pear tree].'

Again, the compatibility of the differential `na` + ACC with MC and its incompatibility with AC may indicate specific syntactic properties of the Deg projection.

In conclusion, a few words about the comparative in English. The English MC allows attributive use – this is due to the absence of agreement in the English noun phrase. As we established earlier, English belongs to the type of languages in which adjectives lack an agreement projection. If other attributes (e.g., the positive degree of the adjective) lack number or case features, their absence in the comparative is not a problem.

English attributive comparatives demonstrate another restriction, namely, their attributive use with a standard of comparison is ungrammatical:

(404) English
- * You are [a cleverer than most of us fellow].
- '*You are a cleverer than most of us fellow.'

(405) * I advise you to read [some prettier than the 'History of the Devil' book].
- '*I advise you to read a prettier than the 'History of the Devil' book.'

In reality, the prohibition on forming such structures is related to the so-called "Final-over-Final Constraint" (Holmberg 2000). Discovered by A. Holmberg, this constraint prohibits embedding phrases with an initial head (`cleverer [than most of us]`, `prettier [than the 'History of the Devil']`) into phrases with a final head (`a fellow`, `some book`), see the explanation of this prohibition in (Biberauer et al. 2009). Obviously, for Russian, such a prohibition is irrelevant (see examples above, as well as cases like `dovol'nyy soboy chelovek` 'a person satisfied with himself', etc.).

## 2.4.8. Summary: Morphology, Syntax, and Semantics of the Comparative

We have examined the peculiarities of using morphological and analytical comparatives in Russian. As we have established, despite outwardly similar functions, the morphological and analytical comparatives have different distributional and semantic restrictions. This is entirely consistent with the conclusion drawn in (AG-80-1: § 1342): "The descriptive expression of comparison using the forms `boleye` 'more' or `meneye` 'less' (`boleye veselyy` 'more cheerful', `boleye interesnyy` 'more interesting', `meneye veselyy` 'less cheerful', `meneye interesnyy` 'less interesting') does not belong to the comparative degree forms. The words `boleye` or `meneye` in these combinations retain their lexical meaning, and this prevents their transformation into a marker of morphological meaning and, consequently, the transformation of combinations like `boleye grustnyy` 'more sad', `meneye veselyy` 'less cheerful' into analytical comparative forms."

We have proposed an analysis of morphological and syntactic structure that would explain the differences between the two means of expressing comparison. The main feature of our analysis is the assertion that the morphological comparative is formed with the participation of syntactic units specified in the function of comparison (primarily – the Deg head), while the analytical comparative is based on the same syntactic structure as the SFs of adjectives. As we have shown, this structural difference leads to differences in semantic and combinatorial properties. In addition, we have tried to build a model describing all syntactic units relevant for the comparison situation (object of comparison and differential). We also discussed the process of semantic shift of non-gradable adjectives.

An important result from the perspective of our proposed theory, which postulates a division of adjectives into adjectivess and attributives, is the following. The semantics and distribution of comparative constructions allow drawing a line between two structures: DegP and AdjP. The first type of constituent, DegP, is aligned with the projection of the SF of the adjective (AdjKP), as it can only take adjectives as a complement. The second type of constituent is the SF of the adjective, which can be formed from both adjectives and attributives. DegP and AdjKP are, therefore, heads oriented towards "adjectives in the narrow sense" (statives).

## Chapter 3. Argument Structure

## 3.1. Participants in Situations Defined by Adjectives and Patterns of Their Realization

## 3.1.1. Core Semantic Participants of Adjectival Predicates

Adjectives define a gradable property. By using lexemes that encode such a property, the speaker evaluates the place of the described object on a scale, cf.: `vysokiy dom` 'tall house' - 'a house which, in my opinion, exceeds the norm for the size of such objects.' One of the most typical participants for adjectives, therefore, is the role of the subject of evaluation:

(406) English (Internet)
Molly might be too sweet for some readers.
'Molly might be too sweet for some readers.'

(407) Ossetian (Vydrin 2011: 241)
Atsy fys-tæ nyn zyn ærtsh-akhs-æn sty.
этот баран-PL.NOM 1.PL.DAT difficult PREF-catch.PRES-NMN be.PRES.3.PL
'It is difficult for us to catch these rams.'

(408) Bagvalal
Di-ha ab miq' š'eralu=b ek°a.
I-DAT this road narrow=N COP
'This road is narrow for me.'

Typologically, a stable way of marking the subject of evaluation is the dative case. In English, the subject of evaluation is encoded by a prepositional phrase with `for` or `to`, in Russian – by the dative case or a prepositional phrase with `dlya` 'for', etc. It should be noted that the distribution of dative encoding and the prepositional phrase with `dlya` in Russian represents a separate problem. While seemingly synonymous at first glance and coinciding in a wide range of contexts, these two techniques, nevertheless, often diverge, cf.: the possible `*nam / dlya nas resheniye` '*to us / for us a solution'; `izvestnaya mne / *dlya menya istoriya` 'a story known to me / *for me'.

Another typologically widespread participant in situations defined by adjectives is the benefactive or malefactive, also often expressed by the dative or a prepositional phrase (English `for / to`, French `à / pour`, etc.):

(409) English (Internet)
These fruits are harmful for you.
'These fruits are harmful to you.'

(410) French (Internet)
L'alcool est nuisible à la sante.
'Alcohol is harmful to health.'

(411) Hungarian (Rákosi 2006: 79)
Jó volt János-nak a találkozás.
good COP John-DAT DEF meeting
'The meeting was convenient for John.'

(412) Ossetian
Atsy khærinag syval-ætt-aen payda u.
this food child-PL-DAT useful be.PRES.3.SG
'This food is useful for children.'

(413) Kyrgyz (Internet)
Al zhak zhylky-lar-ga zhayluu.
this side horses-PL-DAT convenient
'From this side, it's more comfortable for horses.'

(414) Bagvalal
O=j hakuj iƚa zaralija=j ek°a.
this=F woman I.1.PL.DAT harmful=F COP
'This woman is harmful to us.'

In a somewhat broader interpretation, such a participant also corresponds to the stimulus:

(415) Ossetian (Vydrin 2011: 241)
Asimo-im æ nykhas kæn-yn adæymag-æm ækhtson u.
Asimo-COM word do.PRES-INF person-DAT pleasant be.PRES.3.SG
'It is pleasant for a person to talk with Asimo (robot's name).'

Another typologically stable semantic type involves lexemes that postulate identity, equality, similarity with respect to some property, as well as inverse relationships. Participants of such adjectives are usually encoded by the plural, a conjoined noun phrase, a comitative, or a prepositional / oblique case phrase:

(416) English
a. The segment A and the segment B are equal.
   'Segment A and segment B are equal.'
b. The segment A is equal to the segment B.
   'Segment A is equal to segment B.'

(417) French
a. Les Francais et les etrangers sont egals en droit.
   'French people and foreigners are equal in rights.'
b. Les Francais sont egals en droit aux etrangers.
   'French people are equal in rights to foreigners.'

(418) Bagvalal
a. Anwar=la patimati=la w=at'as ek°a.
   Anwar=AND Patimat=AND M=other COP
   'Anwar and Patimat are different.'
b. Anwar w=at'as ek°a patimat-i-č.
   Anwar M=other COP Patimat-OBL-CONT
   'Anwar is different from Patimat.'

(419) Lezgin (D. S. Ganenkov, pers. comm.)
St’xa-jar [[pahliwan-r-i-z] uχšar] q’ehal-ar tir.
brother-PL(ABS) wrestler-PL-OBL-DAT similar brave-PL be:PAST
'The brothers were brave men, similar to wrestlers.'

Another semantic source of adjectival government is lexemes with modal meaning:

(420) Tatar
Sin min-ga kiräk.
you I-DAT need
'You are needed by me.' (lit. 'You to-me needed.')

Such units, however, are far from always being full-fledged adjectives, cf., for example, Russian `mozhno` 'it is possible' / `nado` 'it is necessary', which do not inflect for gender and number and do not have full forms.

* * *

Thus, adjectival lexemes regularly demonstrate the ability to introduce various semantic participants. Typologically, the most stable are dative and dative-synonymous prepositional-case phrases, which mark the subject of evaluation, benefactive / malefactive, stimulus, experiencer, and similar roles. In addition, adjectives in the world's languages can define situations of identity / equality, etc., encoded by plural number, coordination, or prepositional-case phrases.

## 3.1.2. Types of Semantic Participants and Semantic Classes of Governing Adjectives in Russian

### 3.1.2.1. Adjective Government: Obligatory and Optional Participants, Semantic Classes

Adjectives sometimes possess syntactically obligatory valency; a few examples include Russian lexemes `vkhozhiy` 'having access', `raspolozhennyy` 'disposed (to something)', `sklonnyy` 'prone', `prisushchiy` 'inherent', `chrevatyy` 'fraught with', `kratnyy` 'multiple of', `pokhozhiy` 'similar'.

(421) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
a. … osen'yu 1941-go vel delo Amalii Mikhaylovny Berman, sosedki Krasnogorova po lestnichnoy ploshchadke, vkhozhey v ikh dom.
   … autumn-LOC 1941-GEN led case Amalia Mikhaylovna Berman-GEN, neighbor-GEN Krasnogorov-GEN on stairway landing-DAT, having.access-FEM.SG.NOM into their house.
   '…in the autumn of 1941, he handled the case of Amalia Mikhailovna Berman, Krasnogorov's neighbor on the landing, who had access to their house.'
a′. * vkhozhaya sosedka
   *having.access-FEM.SG.NOM neighbor-FEM.SG.NOM
   '*an accessible neighbor'
b. Dlya menya Poseshcheniye - eto prezhde vsego unikal'noye sobytiye, chrevatoye vozmozhnost'yu pereprygnut' srazu cherez neskol'ko stupenek v protsesse poznaniya.
   For me visit-NOM - this primarily unique event-NOM, fraught.with-N.SG.NOM possibility-INSTR jump over several steps-GEN in process-LOC knowledge-GEN.
   'For me, the Visit is first and foremost a unique event, fraught with the possibility of skipping several steps in the process of knowledge at once.'
b′. * chrevatoye sobytiye
   *fraught.with-N.SG.NOM event-NOM
   '*a fraught event'
c. … ne bylo nichego, krome stola, za kotorym sidel, podpershi podborodok kulakami, dlinnovolosyy yunets, pokhozhiy kudryami i nezhnym dlinnym likom na Aleksandra Bloka…
   … NEG was nothing-GEN, except table-GEN, behind which sat, propping.up chin-ACC fists-INSTR, long-haired youth-NOM, similar-M.SG.NOM curls-INSTR and tender-INSTR long-INSTR face-INSTR to Alexander Blok-ACC.
   '…there was nothing but a table, behind which sat, propping his chin with his fists, a long-haired youth, similar in his curls and delicate long face to Alexander Blok…'
c′. * pokhozhiy yunets
   *similar-M.SG.NOM youth-NOM
   '*a similar youth'

The main part of governing adjectives, it seems, possesses obligatory semantic and optional syntactic valency. "Let's call the i-th valency of word A syntactically optional if a sentence containing word A with an unfilled i-th valency is correct" (Apresyan 1995: 149). This definition applies, for example, to participants introduced by adjectives `poleznyy` 'useful', `dostoynyy` 'worthy', `interesnyy` 'interesting', etc.:

(422) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
a. Chital ya tvoy traktat - poleznaya kniga, no glupaya.
   read-M.SG I your treatise-ACC - useful-F.SG book-F.SG, but stupid-F.SG.
   'I read your treatise - a useful book, but a stupid one.'
b. Tak chem ya mogu byt' vam polezna, tovarishch?
   so what-INSTR I can be you-DAT useful-F.SG, comrade-VOC?
   'So how can I be useful to you, comrade?'

(423) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
a. On byl prav: ustupit' dostoynomu protivniku - eto ne pozor.
   he was right: yield-INF worthy-DAT opponent-DAT - this NEG shame.
   'He was right: to yield to a worthy opponent is no disgrace.'
b. … blagorodno otstupit' pered protivnikom, dostoynym pobedy…
   … nobly retreat-INF before opponent-INSTR, worthy-GEN victory-GEN…
   '…to nobly retreat before an opponent worthy of victory…'

(424) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
a. Vy dali mne massu interesnogo materiala.
   you gave me mass-ACC interesting-GEN material-GEN.
   'You gave me a lot of interesting material.'
b. … demonstriruyet svoye bezrazlichiye i dazhe prezreniye ko vsem etim predmetam, «ne interesnym yego narodu»…
   … demonstrates his indifference and even contempt to all these subjects-DAT, «NEG interesting-DAT.PL his people-DAT»…
   '…demonstrates his indifference and even contempt for all these subjects, «not interesting to his people»…'

A similar analysis is proposed, for example, in (Landau 2006): participants in situations defined by adjectives are recognized as syntactic adjuncts. In this approach, noun phrases dependent on adjectives do not fill syntactic valencies but correspond to certain semantic frames associated with particular types of adjectival meanings.

As we established when discussing the semantic properties of adjectives in Chapter 1, the following semantic classes in Russian possess the ability to introduce their own participant:

(425) Semantic classes of Russian adjectives that take dependents
a. EVALUATIVE
   `vazhnyy` 'important', `vtorostepennyy` 'secondary', `gadkiy` 'nasty', `dorogoy` 'dear', `zhutkiy` 'creepy', `zabavnyy` 'amusing', `zagadochnyy` 'mysterious', `zamanchevyy` 'tempting', `zanyatnyy` 'entertaining', `zarazitel'nyy` 'infectious', `interesnyy` 'interesting', `omerzitel'nyy` 'disgusting', `otvratitel'nyy` 'repulsive', `skuchnyy` 'boring', `udachnyy` 'successful', …
b. TEMPORAL
   `dolgi`y 'long', `kratkiy` 'brief', `novyy` 'new', `staryy` 'old'
c. SPATIAL

d. IDENTITY
   `zhenatyy` 'married', `identichnyy` 'identical', `odinakovyy` 'same', `parallel'nyy` 'parallel', `pokhozhiy` 'similar', `ravnyy` 'equal', `razlichnyy` 'different', `raznyy` 'various', `skhozhiy` 'similar', `tozhdestvennyy` 'identical', `ekvivalentnyy` 'equivalent'

f. BENEFACTIVE
   `vrednyy` 'harmful', `vygodnyy` 'profitable', `opasnyy` 'dangerous', `poleznyy` 'useful', `udobnyy` 'convenient', `tsennyy` 'valuable', `chrevatyy` 'fraught with'
g. FAMILIARITY
   `znakomyy` 'familiar', `znamenityy` 'famous', `izvestnyy` 'known', `populyarnyy` 'popular', `proslavlennyy` 'glorified'
h. TYPICALITY
   `obyknovennyy` 'ordinary', `obychnyy` 'usual', `privychnyy` 'accustomed', `svoystvennyy` 'characteristic', `spetsificheskiy` 'specific', `tipichnyy` 'typical', `kharakternyy` 'characteristic', …
i. CONTENT
   `bogaty`y 'rich', `bednyy` 'poor', `polnyy` 'full', `pustoy` 'empty'

A number of classes have a small number of lexemes; in some cases (primarily EVALUATIVE adjectives, adjectives of EMOTIONAL RELATION and TYPICALITY), the examples given above can be supplemented.

Below we will discuss the semantic organization of individual classes and their characteristic actants, as well as examples of semantic participants that combine with different classes of adjectives.

### 3.1.2.2. Government of Individual Semantic Classes

Examples of adjectives whose participants are, to some extent, uniquely determined by their semantic class include the classes of IDENTITY and EMOTIONAL RELATION adjectives, as well as SPATIAL adjectives.

**Class IDENTITY.** In the case of the IDENTITY class, there are two participants in a certain symmetric relationship with each other, see (Iomdin 1981). Adjectival lexemes of this class belong to different ontological types and can introduce, for example, both animate (`Petya i Masha zhenaty` 'Petya and Masha are married') and inanimate participants (`Pryamaya i otrezok parallel'ny` 'A line and a segment are parallel'). In (Vol'f 1978: 38), such lexemes are also grouped together: "However, there are qualificative structures not oriented towards a general evaluation either by quality ('good/bad') or by quantity ('much/little'). Thus, in particular, large series are formed by adjectives which relate an object or event to other objects or events by the feature of similarity or dissimilarity, cf. Spanish `igual` 'equal', `semejante` 'similar', `identico` 'identical', `diferente` 'different, not similar', `distinto` 'different', etc."

A common property of lexemes in the IDENTITY class is their ability to mark both of their participants with a conjoined noun phrase (426) or a plural number (427):

(426) (Internet)
Zachastuyu mozhno uvidet' paru, v kotoroy muzhchina i zhenshchina pokhozhi drug na druga kak brat i sestra.
often can see pair-ACC, in which man-NOM and woman-NOM similar-PL друг on other like brother and sister.
'Often one can see a couple in which the man and woman are similar to each other like brother and sister.'

(427) (Internet)
Eto rodstvenniki s raznitsey v vozraste boleye 200 let, no oni pokhozhi kak nikto drugoy!
this relatives-NOM with difference-INSTR in age more 200 years, but they similar-PL like no one other!
'These are relatives with an age difference of more than 200 years, but they are similar like no one else!'
… yesli neytrino i antineytrino tozhdestvenny, rozhdayutsya 2 elektrona…
… if neutrino-NOM and antineutrino-NOM identical-PL, are.born 2 electrons-NOM…
'…if the neutrino and antineutrino are identical, 2 electrons are born…'
Vse kletki organizma tozhdestvenny po prirode.
all cells-NOM organism-GEN identical-PL by nature.
'All cells of the organism are identical by nature.'

Adjectives of this class predicate an identical relationship between participants: X and Y (Z.Pl) are in relation A means 'X (one part of Z) is in relation A to Y and Y (the other part of Z) is in relation A to X (the first part of Z)'. Alongside this encoding method, it is possible to use a plural pronoun and the comitative preposition `s` 'with': `Oni s Petyey pokhozhi / zhenaty` 'They are similar / married to Petya', etc. For such semantic participants, we will reserve the label `kontragent` 'contragent', see more details below.

An alternative way of marking is to retain (attributive or predicative) agreement with one of the participants in the identity relation and specify the second using prepositional-case or oblique-case constructions:

(428) (Internet)
Chekhertma pokhozha na presnyy kurinyy bul'on.
Chekhertma similar-F.SG to bland chicken broth-ACC.
'Chekhertma is similar to bland chicken broth.'

(429) (Internet)
Etot protsess tozhdestvenen mnogokratno uskorennoy prirodnoy ochistke vody pod vozdeystviyem solnechnogo sveta i kisloroda.
this process-NOM identical-M.SG many.times accelerated natural purification-DAT water-GEN under influence-INSTR solar light-GEN and oxygen-GEN.
'This process is identical to a manifold accelerated natural water purification under the influence of sunlight and oxygen.'

The prepositional-case marking of the second contragent differs for different adjectives of this class, but it demonstrates some regular patterns – for example, most adjectives of this class attach the second participant in the dative case: `tozhdestvennyy / ekvivalentnyy / ravnyy / parallel'nyy komu ili chemu-libo` 'identical / equivalent / equal / parallel to someone or something', etc.

The possibility of coordinative and prepositional-case ways of marking participants, or in other words – the presence of "non-subordinable valencies" (Apresyan 1995)³⁸, represents different ways of encoding the same semantic roles. The syntactic properties of participants expressed through coordination and prepositional-case phrases are different. For example, coordinated noun phrases do not allow the extraction of one of the participants (Coordinate Structure Constraint), while prepositional-case encoding does not exclude such a possibility:

³⁸ "Optional valencies are called, following L. N. Iordanskaya (1961), co-subordinable if they can be realized simultaneously (cf. the verb `arendovat'` 'to rent'). If this is impossible, then the valencies are non-co-subordinable" (Apresyan 1995: 61).

(430) (Internet)
* Kto i Petya zhenaty?
   *who-NOM and Petya-NOM married-PL?
   '*Who and Petya are married?'
Na kom zhenat Petya?
   on whom-LOC married-M.SG Petya-NOM?
   'Who is Petya married to?'

The behavior of coordinated adjective participants is generally similar to that of reciprocal verbs like `tselovat'sya` 'to kiss each other'.

In addition to the described obligatory participants in the identity adjective class, it is possible to express the basis – a role that specifies what the similarity, identity, etc., is based on: `Kletki tozhdestvenny po prirode` 'Cells are identical by nature'; `Lyudi ravny v svoikh pravakh / svoimi pravami / v otnoshenii svoikh prav` 'People are equal in their rights / by their rights / in respect of their rights', etc.; more on this will be discussed below.

**Class EMOTIONAL RELATION.** This class corresponds to the so-called utilitarian evaluation according to (Arutyunova 1988). Adjectives of this class have an obligatory addressee, which is most often marked by the preposition `k` 'to' and the dative case (among a few marking variants for the addressee is `zloy na kogo-to` 'angry at someone'):

(431) (Internet)
Komissar byl ochen' vezhliv k nam i razmestil nas v byvshikh barakakh inostrantsev na fabrike.
commissioner-NOM was very polite-M.SG to us and housed us in former barracks-LOC foreigners-GEN at factory-LOC.
'The commissioner was very polite to us and housed us in the former foreign workers' barracks at the factory.'
Ona vspominala, kak vnimatel'na i zabotliva k ney i ottsu byla mat'.
she recalled, how attentive-F.SG and caring-F.SG to her-DAT and father-DAT was mother-NOM.
'She recalled how attentive and caring their mother was towards her and her father.'
Bud'te dobry k roditelyam, i k vam budut dobry vashi deti…
be-IMP.PL kind-PL to parents-DAT, and to you will.be kind-PL your children-NOM…
'Be kind to your parents, and your children will be kind to you…'

**Class SPATIAL adjectives.** In the semantic class of SPATIAL adjectives, there is a participant that defines the reference point, see also (Kustova 2006). In the case of adjectives `blizkiy` 'close', `blizhniy` 'nearby', this participant is encoded by the preposition `k` 'to' and a dative noun phrase; with adjectives `dal'niy` 'far', `dalekiy` 'distant', the reference point is encoded by the preposition `ot` 'from' and a noun phrase in the genitive case.

(432) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
Vy tut daleki ot istochnikov informatsii, - on oglyadel planetologov.
you here distant-PL from sources-GEN information-GEN, - he surveyed planetologists-ACC.
'You are far from sources of information here," he looked at the planetologists.'
Edik byl blizok k polnoy demoralizatsii - poyavleniye Vybegally yego dokonalo.
Edik-NOM was close-M.SG to full demoralization-DAT - appearance-NOM Vybegalla-GEN him finished-N.SG.
'Edik was close to complete demoralization - Vybegalla's appearance finished him off.'

The inverse marking of the reference point is also possible: `blizhniy ot chego-libo` 'nearby from something', `dal'niy k chemu-libo` 'far to something'. Groups with prepositions `ot` and `k`, again, define the same semantic participant and are non-co-subordinable. In some cases, the reference point may not be expressed and is pragmatically recovered:

(433) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
No direktor «Dzhey-stantsii» ne videl ni zvezd, ni zhelto-zelenogo siyaniya nad blizkimi skalami.
but director-NOM «J-station» NEG saw neither stars-GEN, nor yellow-green-GEN glow-GEN over close-PL.INSTR rocks-INSTR.
'But the director of the "J-station" saw neither stars nor the yellowish-green glow above the nearby cliffs.'
Ochen' uzh dalekaya planeta.
very indeed distant-F.SG planet-F.SG.
'Such a very distant planet.'

Adjectives of this class can also be used with circumstances, cf. `dalekaya segodnya planeta` 'a distant planet today', `blizkiye v tot moment skaly` 'nearby rocks at that moment', etc.

### 3.1.2.3. Semantic (Hyper)roles and Circumstances Used with More Than One Class of Adjectives

Below, we will describe cases where the same participant is used with more than one class of adjectives. We will also discuss some circumstantial dependents characteristic of adjectives.

In connection with the discussion of semantic participants of adjectives, the concept of hyper-role may probably be useful. When applied to constructing a typology of case strategies, the hyper-role toolkit allows for uniting various semantic participants that receive identical encoding, see (Kibrik 1992b: 191-195). In particular, a hyper-role close to the one we are investigating is related to the expression of the addressee: "As a widespread hyper-role of this kind, one can distinguish the Addressee, uniting the roles of Experiencer, Recipient, and Goal, and often having a single case marker - the dative," see (Kibrik 1992b: 194).

As we will show below, it is evidently possible to speak of the following hyper-roles: i) a contragent, uniting in our case the semantic participants of the EMOTIONAL RELATION and IDENTITY classes; ii) a hyper-role of the subject of evaluation, which stands for participants with close semantic roles of experiencer, benefactive, and target standard; iii) a hyper-role of basis or content.

**Contragent.** The role of the contragent, originally proposed by Charles Fillmore, appears as follows in Yu. D. Apresyan's interpretation: "We will call an active participant a contragent in a situation that also involves an active subject, and the actions of these two participants do not coincide: the predicate describes completely only the subject's activity, but not the contragent's activity. Thus, in a lending situation, the subject borrows money, and the contragent lends it; in a defense situation, the subject defends, and the contragent attacks, etc." (Apresyan 1995: 127).

Our use of the term "contragent" will be somewhat conventional, as adjective participants are by nature never agentive. The term "contragent" will be used by us in relation to adjectival valencies because in a number of cases (IDENTITY and EMOTIONAL RELATION classes), the participants of a certain adjective are two – to some extent active, but principal for the given situation – objects.

Thus, the role of contragent for adjectives corresponds to a non-agentive participant, alongside which there is some "primary" actant.

Adjectives of EMOTIONAL RELATION can mark the addressee valency by means of the preposition `s` 'with' and a noun phrase in the instrumental case:

(434) (Internet)
Vse sotrudniki MZHD budut odinakovo vezhlivy s passazhirami.
all employees-NOM MZHD will.be equally polite-PL with passengers-INSTR.
'All MZHD employees will be equally polite to passengers.'
Krayne vnimatel'na i zabotliva s det'mi, sklonna ikh opekat' i zashchishchat'.
extremely attentive-F.SG and caring-F.SG with children-INSTR, prone-F.SG them foster-INF and protect-INF.
'Extremely attentive and caring with children, prone to foster and protect them.'
Tsezar' ser'yeznyy i v to zhe vremya laskovyy i dobryy so svoimi khozyayevami…
Caesar-NOM serious-M.SG and at that same time affectionate-M.SG and kind-M.SG with his owners-INSTR…
'Caesar is serious and at the same time affectionate and kind with his owners…'

Paraphrasing into a prepositional phrase in the instrumental case with the preposition `s` is permissible for almost all adjectives of this class. Such government is also possible for participants of the IDENTITY adjective class:

(435) (Internet)
Demi s Eshtonom zhenaty uzhe 6 let…
Demi-NOM with Ashton-INSTR married-PL already 6 years…
'Demi and Ashton have been married for 6 years already…'
Po prirode svoyey filosofiya kak ratsional'noye poznaniye dolzhna imet' odinakovyy s naukoy tip dvizheniya v istorii…
by nature-LOC her-F.SG philosophy-NOM as rational-N.SG knowledge-NOM must have same-M.SG with science-INSTR type-ACC movement-GEN in history-LOC…
'By its nature, philosophy as rational cognition should have the same type of historical movement as science…'

It seems that in the case of both the addressee of EMOTIONAL RELATION adjectives and the encoding of the second participant of IDENTITY adjectives, the described surface marking corresponds to the role of a contragent.

**Subject of evaluation / experiencer / benefactive.** The core of the adjective class largely consists of evaluative lexemes. Evaluative lexemes differ in that they can take modifiers of the degree of manifestation of a property (`ochen'` 'very', `slishkom` 'too', `sovsem` 'completely', `nemnogo` 'a little', `neskol'ko` 'several', etc.). Sometimes such modifiers are adverbs derived from the evaluative adjectives themselves (`zhutko` 'terribly', `strashno` 'frighteningly', `udivitel'no` 'surprisingly', …). Not only adjectives, but also verbs (`ustavat'` 'to get tired', `radovat'sya` 'to rejoice', …) or nouns (`negodyay` 'scoundrel', `beda` 'trouble', …) can be evaluative – they also combine with the listed intensifiers (`ochen' radovat'sya` 'to rejoice very much', `bol'shaya beda` 'great trouble', etc.). For adjectives, nevertheless, this function seems most typical: "For adjectives as a class of words, the presence of subjective-evaluative meanings and corresponding connotations is characteristic. Thus, the semantic and pragmatic planes of an utterance are linked in the very semantics of adjectives" (Vol'f 1978: 8).

Here is how Ye. M. Vol'f describes the evaluation situation: "A typical qualificative structure includes four elements: the qualification itself – the adjective, the subject of qualification, the object of qualification, and the basis of qualification" (Ibid: 35).

In semantics, following E. Sapir (Sapir 1949), it is customary to associate evaluative (scalar, qualitative) adjectives with some (conventionalized) level of property manifestation D, see, for example, (Mel'chuk 1998: 117; Morzycki 2015). By generating examples like `vysokaya devushka` 'tall girl', the speaker implies that the girl's height reaches some value D that exceeds the standard.

In an evaluation situation, therefore, the subject of evaluation, who performs the comparison of the situation defined by the adjective with some standard, is always implicitly present. The logical subject of evaluation corresponds to the semantic role of the experiencer. In Russian, the main means of surface expression of the experiencer is the genitive group with the preposition `dlya` 'for', cf. EVALUATIVE adjectives below:

(436) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
Yemu kazalos' nechestnym vvyazyvat'sya v spor, beznadezhnyy dlya protivnika.
him-DAT seemed dishonest-N.SG get.involved-INF in dispute-ACC, hopeless-M.SG for opponent-GEN.
'It seemed dishonest to him to get involved in a dispute hopeless for the opponent.'
Govorun byl v beshenstve i, kak vsegda, nakhodyas' v vozbuzhdennom sostoyanii, ispuska`l sil'nyy, nepriyatnyy dlya nepyushchego Fedora zapakh dorogogo kon'yaka «Kurvua'z'ye».
Govorun-NOM was in rage-LOC and, as always, being-ADV in excited-LOC state-LOC, emitted strong-ACC, unpleasant-ACC for non-drinker-GEN Fyodor-GEN smell-ACC expensive-GEN cognac-GEN «Courvoisier».
'Govorun was enraged and, as always, being in an agitated state, emitted a strong, unpleasant smell of expensive Courvoisier cognac for the non-drinking Fyodor.'
Kak budto kazhdyy raz, kogda on ukhodit v reys, na Zemle ostayetsya kakoye-to neobychayno vazhnoye delo, samoye vazhnoye dlya lyudey…
as if every time, when he goes on trip-ACC, on Earth remains some-N.SG extremely important-N.SG affair-NOM, most important-N.SG for people-GEN…
'As if every time he goes on a trip, some extraordinarily important matter remains on Earth, the most important for people…'

Alongside the experiencer itself, such a marking can be obtained by a noun phrase with which it is linked by a possessive (and some ontological) relationship:

(437) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
… prosten'kiye pesennyye melodii, ochen' milyye, vpolne priyemlemyye dlya slukha zemlyan…
… simple-PL.NOM song-PL.NOM melodies-NOM, very nice-PL.NOM, quite acceptable-PL.NOM for hearing-GEN earthlings-GEN…
'…simple song melodies, very nice, quite acceptable to the ear of earthlings…'
Ona ispustila protyazhnyy, nepriyatnyy dlya slukha vizg i polosnula Kharona nogtyami po fizionomii.
she emitted prolonged-ACC, unpleasant-ACC for hearing-GEN screech-ACC and slashed Charon-ACC nails-INSTR on face-DAT.
'She let out a prolonged, unpleasant screech and slashed Charon's face with her nails.'
Vse malo-mal'ski godnyye dlya obitaniya tochki my obsledovali.
all little-NEG-NEG suitable-PL.ACC for habitation-GEN points-ACC we surveyed.
'We surveyed all points, however suitable for habitation.'

Here, obviously, a metonymic transfer takes place: 'suitable for X' = 'suitable for X's habitation', etc.; similar observations are made in all cases where this participant is permissible.

In addition to EVALUATIVE adjectives, the subject of evaluation / experiencer can be used with adjectives of other classes related to the mental operation of evaluation, for example, TEMPORAL, IDENTITY, TYPICALITY, etc.

(438) (Internet)
Kak pravil'no perevesti akvariumnykh ryb v novuyu dlya nikh vodu?
how correctly transfer-INF aquarium-GEN fish-GEN into new-ACC for them-GEN water-ACC?
'How to correctly transfer aquarium fish into new water for them?'
Ukazat' imya rabochey gruppy, identichnoye dlya vsekh ustroystv v seti.

'Specify the workgroup name, identical for all devices on the network.'
And how melodiously the most ordinary tomato sounds to us in its native language!

Finally, a participant with a role superficially similar to an experiencer, but closer to a benefactive, is present in all adjectives of the BENEFACTIVE class:

(439) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
Cherez davleniye, opasnoye dlya psikhiki i dazhe dlya samoy zhizni.
'Through pressure dangerous to the psyche and even to life itself.'
Ukazannyy № 819360 yest' skrytyy kommunist i bezuslovno, vrednyy dlya poryadka chelovek.
'The specified No. 819360 is a hidden communist and, undoubtedly, a person harmful to order.'
… v yego vremennom zhilishche ya ne naydu nichego dlya sebya poleznogo.
'…in his temporary dwelling, I will find nothing useful for myself.'

An alternative way of encoding the subject of evaluation / experiencer / benefactive is a noun phrase in the dative case:

(440) (Internet)
Odnako sushchestvuyut i kuda boleye ranimyye lyudi, kotorym vazhen bukval'no kazhdyy aspekt obshcheniya s vami.
'However, there are much more vulnerable people, for whom literally every aspect of communication with you is important.'
S samoy lechebnoy smes'yu, ne soderzhashchuyu opasnyy nam fenilalanin…
'With the very medicinal mixture that does not contain phenylalanine, which is dangerous for us…'
Slishkom kaloriynaya pishcha vredna ne tol'ko detyam…
'Too caloric food is harmful not only to children…'
Komu polezny proroshchennyye semena? Vsem!
'For whom are sprouted seeds useful? For everyone!'

In some cases, dative encoding seems to be the only possible option. This is how, for example, the FAMILIARITY class of adjectives behaves (cf.: ?? `izvestnyy` / ?? `znakomyy dlya kogo-libo` '?? known / ?? familiar for someone'):

(441) (Internet)
20 otkrytok o tom, kak poyavilis' izvestnyye vsem slova.
'20 postcards about how words known to everyone appeared.'
… raznotsvetnyye mozaichnyye risunki perepletayutsya v prichudlivyye uzory, khorosho znakomyye vsem lyubitelyam iskusstva.
'…multicolored mosaic patterns intertwine into whimsical designs, well known to all art lovers.'

**Sentential Complements.** A distinct type of participant, regularly found across different classes of Russian adjectives, consists of sentential complements, which receive various markings. Let's briefly describe the main models of sentential government for adjectives in Russian.

Firstly, it should be noted that the so-called tough-movement (see section 3.1.3 below) is absent in Russian in the form it takes in English:

(442) a. Obmanut' Petyu (nam) legko / trudno.
   to deceive Petya (for us) easy / difficult
   'It is easy / difficult (for us) to deceive Petya.'
b. * Petya legkiy / trudnyy (chtoby) obmanut'.
   Petya easy / difficult (in order to) deceive
   '*Petya is easy / difficult (in order) to deceive.'

Furthermore, Russian adjectives often attach finite clauses with the conjunction `chto` 'that'. In this case, a dative experiencer can be explicitly expressed:

(443) (Nam) Izvestno / stranno / zabavno, chto Petya postupil v aspiranturu.
   (to us) known / strange / amusing that Petya entered into graduate.school
   '(To us) It is known / strange / amusing that Petya entered graduate school.'

For some adjectives, the dative experiencer is inadmissible:

(444) (*Nam) Vozmozhno / primechatel'no / glupo / udachno, chto Petya postupil v aspiranturu.
   (*to us) possible / remarkable / stupid / lucky that Petya entered into graduate.school
   '(*To us) It is possible / remarkable / stupid / lucky that Petya entered graduate school.'

A number of adjectives allow an infinitive sentential complement whose subject is coreferential with an expressed or implicit dative experiencer:

(445) (Nam) Stranno / zabavno / opasno / polezno spat' dnem na solntse.
   (to us) strange / amusing / dangerous / useful to.sleep day at sun
   '(To us) It is strange / amusing / dangerous / useful to sleep in the sun during the day.'

There are also lexemes similar to non-ergative Italian adjectives (see section 3.1.3 below), which, however, do not allow an ergative variant in Russian:

(446) a. My uvereny / soglasny / gordy / schastlivy, chto Petya postupil v aspiranturu.
   we sure / agree / proud / happy that Petya entered into graduate.school
   'We are sure / agree / proud / happy that Petya entered graduate school.'
b. * Chto Petya postupil v aspiranturu, uvereno / soglasno / gordo / schastlivo.
   that Petya entered into graduate.school sure / agreeable / proud / happy
   '*That Petya entered graduate school is sure / agreeable / proud / happy.'

A separate class of Russian adjectives resembles English mental adjectives. Such adjectives express the mental subject as a nominative subject, while attaching an infinitive sentential actant preceded by `chtoby` 'in order to'. Like their English counterparts, such adjectives can be used in an impersonal construction with an infinitive:

(447) a. Petya (dostatochno) predusmotritelen / umen / glup / prozorliv, chtoby postupit' v aspiranturu.
   Petya (enough) prudent / clever / stupid / perceptive in.order.to enter into graduate.school
   'Petya is (smart) enough / clever / stupid / perceptive to enter graduate school.'
b. Postupit' v aspiranturu - (eto) predusmotritel'no / umno / glupo / prozorlivo.
   to.enter into graduate.school - (this is) prudent / clever / stupid / perceptive
   'To enter graduate school - (this is) prudent / clever / stupid / perceptive.'

Finally, there is a class of modal adjectives that attach a desiderative infinitive with `chtoby` and an optional experiencer:

(448) (Nam) Nuzhno / vozmozhno / neobkhodimo / khorosho, chtoby Petya postupil v aspiranturu.
   (to us) necessary / possible / imperative / good that Petya entered into graduate.school
   '(To us) It is necessary / possible / imperative / good that Petya enter graduate school.'

This list does not exhaust the models of government for Russian adjectives with sentential complements. Be that as it may, it is quite problematic to identify a class of adjectives with external and internal participants based on Russian material.

**Target Standard.** The hyper-role of benefactive has another interesting feature, which manifests in semantic classes that do not possess the ability to govern. Thus, for adjectives of the SIZE, PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, and CHARACTER TRAITS AND HUMAN STATES classes, which usually do not have syntactic participants, such participants appear when an intensifier (`slishkom` 'too', `ochen'` 'very', `ves'ma` 'quite', etc.) is used with them – we will define such uses as a target standard:

(449) ?? vkhod, uzkiy dlya kolyaski
   entrance, narrow for stroller
   '?? an entrance narrow for a stroller'
?? vysokaya dlya rebenka temperatura
   high for child temperature
   '?? a high temperature for a child'
?? voda v vanne goryachaya dlya malysha
   water in bath hot for baby
   '?? bath water hot for the baby'
?? umnyy dlya starsheklassnika yunosha
   smart for high.schooler youth
   '?? a smart youth for a high school student'

(450) (Internet)
Vkhod v zavedeniye slishkom uzkiy dlya kolyaski.
'The entrance to the establishment is too narrow for a stroller.'
Vyzvat' skoruyu, eto ochen' vysokaya dlya rebenka temperatura…
'Call an ambulance, this is a very high temperature for a child…'
Slyshala (ot vrachey), chto yesli vodichka v vannoy chereschur goryachaya dlya malysha…
'I heard (from doctors) that if the water in the bath is too hot for the baby…'
Ochen' umnyy dlya starsheklassnika Kendzi Koyso pytayetsya ustranit' vyzvannuyu yego prosveshchennoy glupost'yu problemu v global'noy seti.
'Kenji Koisho, very smart for a high school student, is trying to eliminate a problem in the global network caused by his enlightened stupidity.'

Another context in which a missing or marginal role, for example in attributive uses, becomes (more) grammatical, is predicative use in the short form (Arutyunova 1988: 240):

(451) (Internet)
Dver' ostorozhno priotkrylas', i likhoradochno-blednyy mag yele protisnulsya v otkryvshiysya proyem, slovno tot byl uzok dlya nego.
'The door cautiously opened ajar, and the feverishly pale mage barely squeezed through the opening, as if it was too narrow for him.'
Eta temperatura vysoka dlya stabil'nogo soyedineniya otsinkovannykh staley bez povrezhdeniya pokrytiya.
'This temperature is too high for stable joining of galvanized steels without damaging the coating.'
Tak zhe vozmutilas' i svekrov', chto voda goryacha dlya malysha…
'The mother-in-law also got indignant that the water was too hot for the baby…'
Chetyrekh"yadernyy protsessor M8s Kodi Xbmc Amlogic S812 umen dlya Android.
'The quad-core processor M8s Kodi Xbmc Amlogic S812 is smart for Android.'

The target standard is introduced with an intensifier and specifies the typical degree of manifestation of the property for the given adjective.

The influence of intensifiers on the properties of adjectival dependents has been well-studied for English, see (Nissenbaum, Schwarz 2011) and references therein. The first to make such an observation for English was R. Jackendoff, see (Jackendoff 1972), but he, like subsequent researchers of English adjectives, spoke more about the dependence of the (properties of) target participants (infinitives) on the presence of intensifiers:

(452) English (Jackendoff 1972: 227)
a. The mattress is thin.
b. * The mattress is thin to sleep on.
c. The mattress is too thin to sleep on.

(453) English (Jackendoff 1972: 227)
a. The football is soft.
b. * The football is soft to kick.
c. The football is soft enough to kick.

As can be seen from the Russian translations, the same dependence of target infinitives on intensifiers is observed in Russian as well.

We believe that the evaluative structure present at the semantic level in non-governing adjectives receives syntactic expression when intensifiers are introduced. In terms of the configurational approach, the presence of an intensifier may indicate the existence of a special functional projection, of which the intensifier is an adjunct. The same projection is also responsible for introducing a complement with the preposition `dlya` 'for'.

A similar effect is observed in the case of a nominal projection: in a number of contexts, some nouns develop an addressee valency, see (Grashchenkov, Markman 2010):

(454) Dima byl mne drugom.
   Dima was to.me a.friend
   'Dima was a friend to me.'
Ona byla mne sestroy.
   she was to.me a.sister
   'She was a sister to me.'

Dative government or, alternatively, a prepositional phrase with `dlya` 'for' (`On byl dlya menya drugom` 'He was a friend for me') appears only in a specific (predicative) context, cf.: `*On obidel druga Dime` '*He offended a friend to Dima', etc. Similar participants – both the target standard and the target infinitive – are also "induced" by modifiers in the verb phrase:

(455) (Internet)
a. Khorosho strelyayesh' dlya khudozhnika, pryamo v serdtse.
   well shoot for artist, right in heart
   'You shoot well for an artist, right into the heart.'
b. Segodnya ya slishkom ustal, chtoby prodolzhat' put'…
   today I too tired, in.order.to continue way
   'Today I am too tired to continue on my way…'

(456) a. * Strelyayesh' dlya khudozhnika, pryamo v serdtse.
   shoot for artist, right in heart
   '*You shoot for an artist, right into the heart.'
b. * Ya ustal, chtoby prodolzhat' put'…
   I tired, in.order.to continue way
   '*I am tired to continue on my way…'

Starting with (Pylkkänen 2002)'s dissertation, it has been widely accepted that such participants are introduced into the structure by a special applicative projection; see also applications of this approach to Russian material in (Pshekhotskaya 2012). As it seems to us, in the case of stative predicates, due to the absence of a phase corresponding to causative and process stages, the benefactive is reinterpreted as an experiencer / target standard.

It can be assumed that two types of structures underlie target standards.

In the case of attributive use of adjective phrases like `slishkom dorogoy mne chelovek` 'a person too dear to me', we will apply the same analysis as for the analytical comparative. Modifiers like `ochen'` 'very', `slishkom` 'too', etc., just like comparative modifiers like `boleye` 'more', have the ability to introduce their own arguments, cf. `* (ochen') umnyy dlya starsheklassnika yunosha` '*(very) smart youth for a high school student', `* (boleye) trudnyy, chem matematika, predmet` '*(more) difficult than mathematics, subject'. As in section 2.4, we will analyze the heads `ochen'`, `slishkom`, etc., as adjuncts to the SF of the adjective. In the complement position of the projections they head are prepositional phrases with `dlya` 'for':

(457)
<!-- image -->

In the case of predicative use with a sentential complement `chtoby` 'in order to', it can be assumed that an applicative projection is built above the adjective phrase:

(458)
<!-- image -->

Such a configuration, i.e., the placement of the experiencer / target standard in the complement position, and the adjective phrase in the specifier, is supported by two facts. Firstly, the complements of adjectives are closer to the adjective than the target participant (which also occupies a complement position, but of a higher projection):

(459) (Internet)
Ne obrashchay vnimaniya na moyego brata, on slishkom [zol na mir], chtoby govorit' s drugimi normal'no!
'Don't pay attention to my brother, he is too [angry at the world] to talk to others normally!'
Staryy dobryy Klub Pisateley okazalsya slishkom [star i slishkom dobr k sebe], chtoby prinyat' takiye novovvedeniya.
'The good old Writers' Club turned out to be too [old and too kind to itself] to accept such innovations.'
… v «Reale» slishkom [dovol'ny Navasom i Kasil'yey], chtoby davat' 50 millionov za cheloveka, kotoryy cherez god dostanetsya besplatno.
'…Real (Madrid) is too [satisfied with Navas and Casilla] to give 50 million for a player who will be available for free in a year.'
… etot proyekt slishkom [dorog nam], chtoby brosat' vse na polputi.
'…this project is too [dear to us] to abandon everything halfway.'

In the examples above, the adjective phrase projections with their lexical dependents are higher in the structure than the `chtoby`-infinitives, which we assume are in the specifier position of the ApplP projection.

Secondly, the lexical complement of an adjective, even if expressed by an oblique-case (rather than a prepositional) phrase, does not c-command the `chtoby`-clause. If c-command occurs, the noun phrase cannot be coreferential with the subject of the `chtoby`-clause, expressed by a pronoun:

(460) Drug_i Peti_j priyekhal v gosti, chtoby on *i,j nemnogo otdokhnul.
   friend_NOM_i Petya_GEN_j arrived to.visit, so.that he_(*i,j) a.little rested
   'Petya's friend arrived to visit so that he could rest a little.'
Na kom zhenat Petya?
   on whom_LOC married Petya_NOM
   'Who is Petya married to?'

In this example, the pronominal subject can only refer to the noun phrase `Peti` 'Petya's', because only this noun phrase does not c-command the subject `on` 'he'. In the sentences below, the pronominal subject of the finite `chtoby`-clause can refer to the adjective's lexical complement:

(461) V «Reale» slishkom dovol'ny Navasom, chtoby on ushel v drugoy klub.
   in Real too satisfied Navas-INSTR, so.that he left into other club
   'In Real (Madrid), they are too happy with Navas for him to leave for another club.'
… etot proyekt slishkom dorog Pete, chtoby on brosil vse na polputi.
   this project too dear Petya-DAT, so.that he abandoned everything on halfway
   '…this project is too dear to Petya for him to abandon everything halfway.'

This suggests that at no point in the derivation is there a c-command relationship between the dative participant and the dependent `chtoby`-clause. This corresponds to the structure³⁹ we proposed above, where the adjective phrase is in the specifier of the applicative projection, and the experiencer / target standard is in the complement:

³⁹ Although this is, naturally, not the only structure satisfying this condition.

In conclusion of the discussion of the `dlya` 'for' participant, let's recall another observation made earlier about the argument structure of adjectives. Most valent adjectives obligatorily have a short form, cf.: `bezrazlichen` / `bespristrasten` / `blagozhelatelen k chemu-libo` 'indifferent / impartial / well-wishing to something'; `identichen` / `odinakov s chem-libo` 'identical / same with something'; `zhenat na kom-libo` 'married to someone'; `interesen` / `omerzitelen chem-libo` 'interesting / disgusting by something', etc. This generalization is regularly violated by the `dlya` 'for' participant:

(463) (Internet)
V etom istoricheskom dlya nas sezone, kogda vnov' otkroyet dveri Osnovnaya stsena Bol'shogo teatra…
'In this historic season for us, when the Main Stage of the Bolshoi Theater will reopen its doors…'
Eto ne byl klassicheskiy dlya nashego futbola sluchay podsizhivaniya assistentom…
'This was not a classic case for our football of an assistant undermining [someone]…'
V stol' pozdniy dlya Pitera chas zhelayushchikh sovershat' promenad ne nablyudayetsya.
'At such a late hour for Piter (St. Petersburg), no one willing to take a stroll is observed.'
V minuvshem sezone, stavshem debyutnym dlya krasno-belykh, oni nabrali 50 ochkov v 30 matchakh.
'In the past season, which became the debut for the red-and-whites, they scored 50 points in 30 matches.'

Adjectives with the suffix `-sk`, as is known, do not have a short form; the same can be said about `pozdniy` 'late', `debyutnyy` 'debut', and some other lexemes that fully allow government by a prepositional phrase with `dlya` 'for'. This also indicates that the source of government in such cases is not the lexical structure of the adjectives. Both structures proposed above introduce the `dlya`-participant independently of the adjective. One structure contains the `dlya`-group in the intensifier's complement, the other in the complement of the Appl projection.

To summarize: the experiential participant, corresponding to the subject of evaluation in the semantic structure of adjectives, has a universal nature.

**Basis / Content.** As stated in (Vol'f 1978: 35), "Another element of the qualificative structure – the 'point of reference' (criterion or basis of qualification) can be explicitly indicated in the text, including by the very semantics of the adjective, but can also be implied based on the speaker's subjective understanding of the given situation (in actual evaluation) or of a 'normative,' 'averaged' state of affairs." Such a participant corresponds to the role of the basis of evaluation or content and is characteristic of adjectives of the CONTENT, EVALUATIVE, and BENEFACTIVE classes, as well as for part of the IDENTITY class adjectives and, sporadically, for some others. One way of expression is a noun phrase in the instrumental case:

(464) (Internet)
Po sravneniyu s drugimi yagodami chernika bedna vitaminami, ikh dazhe v 20 raz bol'she v yeyo list'yakh, chem v plodakh.
'Compared to other berries, blueberries are poor in vitamins; there are even 20 times more of them in their leaves than in the fruits.'
Kniga, o kotoroy poydet rech', prezhde vsego interesna vzglyadom na sovremennuyu russkuyu provintsiyu.
'The book in question is, first and foremost, interesting for its view on contemporary Russian province.'
Khek polezen bogatym naborom vitaminov, yoda…
'Hake is useful for its rich set of vitamins, iodine…'
Izgolov'ye krovati i divan, skhozhiye svoimi plavnymi liniyami, sozdayut uyutnuyu rasslablyayushchuyu atmosferu.
'The headboard of the bed and the sofa, similar in their smooth lines, create a cozy, relaxing atmosphere.'

Alternatively, the basis of evaluation can be expressed by a prepositional phrase with `po` 'by' / `v` 'in' and (optionally) a possessive reflexive:

(465) (Internet)
Chto by i kto by tam ni govoril, a Ronaldu genialen v svoyey igre!
'Whatever and whoever might say, Ronaldo is brilliant in his game!'
Vse kletki organizma tozhdestvenny po prirode.
'All cells of the organism are identical by nature.'

(466) … mnogoobraznyy po sostavu i unikal'nyy v svoyey sovokupnosti material po istorii otechestvennoy etnografii i antropologii…
'…diverse in composition and unique in its entirety material on the history of domestic ethnography and anthropology…'

(468) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
Vse-taki chelovek po svoyey prirode neblagodaren i ravnodushen…
'After all, man is by his nature ungrateful and indifferent…'
Vo vsyakom sluchaye, yesli eto i ne ad, to nechto sovershenno neotlichimoye po svoim proyavleniyam.
'In any case, if it is not hell, then it is something completely indistinguishable in its manifestations.'
On izlozhil Brombergu v vysshey stepeni zagadochnuyu i chertovski soblaznitel'nuyu v svoyey zagadochnosti legendu…
'He presented Bromberg with a legend that was highly mysterious and devilishly tempting in its mysteriousness…'

**Complex Prepositions.** The semantic participant of adjectives is, as a rule, syntactically optional ("weak" in Apresyan's terminology) and does not have a fixed surface means of expression. In such cases, complex prepositions like `v otnoshenii kogo-libo` 'in relation to someone' (or `v otnoshenii k komu-libo`), `po otnoshenii kogo-libo` 'with regard to someone' (or `po otnoshenii k komu-libo`) are often used. In the examples below, they introduce a participant semantically close to an addressee:

(467) (Internet)
Zasolennost' zemel' vela k snizheniyu urozhayev i postepennoy zamene pshenitsy na boleye vynoslivyy v otnoshenii soli yachmen'.
'Soil salinity led to reduced yields and the gradual replacement of wheat with barley, which is more resistant to salt.'

(L. N. Andreyev, "T'ma")
«Merzost' kakaya!» -podumal pristav, khotya v otnoshenii chistoty byl chelovek netrebovatel'nyy…
'"What an abomination!" - thought the precinct officer, although concerning cleanliness he was an undemanding man…'

It should be noted that the adjectives `vynoslivyy` 'resistant' / `netrebovatel'nyy` 'undemanding' have the ability to attach a participant in the dative case with the preposition `k` 'to', to whom the property defined by them would extend:

(469) (Internet)
Iskusstvennyy material - produkt tekhnologichnyy i boleye vynoslivyy ko vsem prirodnym vozdeystviyam.
'Artificial material is a technological product and more resistant to all natural influences.'

(471) … ikh i tak khorosho znayut novichki v Linux, kotorym vazhen netrebovatel'nyy k resursam distributiv.
'…Linux newcomers already know them well, for whom a resource-undemanding distribution is important.'

The complex preposition `v otnoshenii (k)` can also be used with adjectives that do not have a valency for a prepositional phrase with `k` and the dative (cf.: `*korrektnyy` / `*spravedlivyy` / `*bezzabotnyy` / `*pravdivyy` / `*ostorozhnyy k chemu-libo` '*correct / *just / *carefree / *truthful / *cautious to something'):

(Internet)
On ochen' pravdivyy v otnoshenii vsego etogo nepopravimogo puti…
'He is very truthful with regard to this whole irreparable path…'

(From the works of A. V. Chayanov)
Neskol'ko goryachikh golov… trebovali, chtoby maestro, stol' ostorozhnyy v otnoshenii svoyey slavy…
'Several hotheads… demanded that the maestro, so cautious concerning his fame…'

In such adjectives, a semantic participant with an addressee role is most likely absent, and the prepositions `v otnoshenii` / `po otnosheniyu k` 'in relation to / with regard to' introduce a circumstant with similar semantics. The optional participant of such adjectives, even if they lack (addressee) valency for the preposition `k` with the dative, can nevertheless be expressed by a complex preposition containing `k`:

(473) (From the works of L. N. Tolstoy)
Stepan Arkad'ich byl chelovek pravdivyy v otnoshenii k sebe samomu.
'Stepan Arkadievich was a truthful man with regard to himself.'

(474) (Internet)
Malen'kiy, zabotlivyy i ostorozhnyy v otnoshenii k cheloveku, kotoryy yemu vazhen i nuzhen.
'Small, caring and cautious in relation to a person who is important and needed by him.'

Let's also give a few examples with the preposition `po otnosheniyu k`:

(475) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
Dopolnitel'nym po otnosheniyu k etomu zakonu yavlyayetsya zakon nepreryvnogo vosproizvodstva razuma.
'Complementary to this law is the law of continuous reproduction of reason.'
-Izvini, konechno, no eto ne sovsem chestno po otnosheniyu k drugim.
'-Excuse me, of course, but that's not entirely fair to others.'

(476) (A. I. Solzhenitsyn. "Bodalsya telenok s dubom")
… moye pis'mo, takoye gruboye po otnosheniyu k svyashchennoy klassovoy bor'be…
'…my letter, so rude with regard to the sacred class struggle…'

Note that the complex preposition `po otnosheniyu k` 'with regard to' is almost never found in the form `bez k` 'without k', whereas `v otnoshenii` 'in relation to' is used more often in modern Russian than `v otnoshenii k`. In Russian of previous eras, `v otnoshenii k` was most likely more frequent:

(477) (D. V. Grigorovich. "Pereselentsy")
Nado dumat', odnakozh, ne vse tak bezzabotny v otnoshenii k dobru svoyemu…
'One must think, however, not everyone is so carefree with regard to their property…'

(478) (V. G. Belinskiy. "Razdeleniye poezii na rody i vidy")
Epicheskaya poeziya yest' po preimushchestvu poeziya ob"yektivnaya, vneshnyaya, kak v otnoshenii k samoy sebe, tak i k poetu i yego chitatelyu.
'Epic poetry is preeminently objective, external poetry, both in relation to itself and to the poet and his reader.'

Both prepositions are most likely undergoing a grammaticalization process related to phonological reduction. Possibly, this will be accompanied by a change in the government of some semantic classes of adjectives – the participants introduced by such prepositions will change from optional to obligatory.

**Circumstants.** Another confirmation that adjectives can independently define situations, their participants, and the conditions of their occurrence is the ability of adjectives to be used with adverbs of time (479) and place (480) of action:

(479) (Internet)
Osobenno nepriyatny morshchiny, poyavivshiyesya mezhdu brovey, oni pridayut ikh obladatelyam postoyanno nedovol'nyy i nakhmurennyy vid.
'Especially unpleasant are wrinkles that appear between the eyebrows; they give their owners a constantly dissatisfied and frowning appearance.'
V rezul'tate pozhara 1810 goda byli unichtozheny znachitel'naya chast' goroda i glavnyy v to vremya khram - tserkov' Il'i Proroka…
'As a result of the 1810 fire, a significant part of the city and the main church at that time – the church of Elijah the Prophet – were destroyed…'
… tikhiy gorodok, vse tak zhe, kak stoletiye nazad, lenivo-pyl'nyy v letniye dni, gryaznyy v osennuyu i vesennuyu rasputitsu…
'…a quiet town, still, just like a century ago, lazily dusty in summer days, dirty in autumn and spring slush…'

(480) (Internet)
Tem vremenem v severnuyu stolitsu dlya rassledovaniya neobychnogo ubiystva pribyvayet Yuriy Fedra, izvestnyy v svoyem gorode detektiv.
'Meanwhile, Yuri Fedra, a detective known in his city, arrives in the northern capital to investigate an unusual murder.'
Nazvana samaya populyarnaya sredi turistov strana.
'The most popular country among tourists has been named.'
Vy ne budete stalkivat'sya s takoy problemoy, kak propechennyy snaruzhi, no syroy vnutri pirog.
'You will not encounter such a problem as a pie baked on the outside but raw on the inside.'

For adjectives denoting qualities, temporal correlation is generally less relevant than for verbs, see (Bulygina, Shmelev 1997: 49-58). Obviously, semantic classes also determine, to some extent, compatibility with circumstants. Thus, emotional states described by the CHARACTER TRAITS AND HUMAN STATES class (`postoyanno nedovol'nyy` 'constantly dissatisfied') change over time; as a result, such adjectives often combine with adverbs of time. The same is characteristic of adjectives of the PHYSICAL PROPERTIES class (`gryaznyy v rasputitsu` 'dirty in slush'), for which the place of manifestation of the property is also relevant (`syroy vnutri` 'raw inside'). For adjectives of the FAMILIARITY class, indicating the "space" in which knowledge about the object spreads is also characteristic, which is why they are regularly used with prepositional-case groups headed by prepositions `sredi` 'among', `v` 'in', etc. (`populyarnaya sredi turistov` 'popular among tourists', `izvestnyy v svoyem gorode` 'known in one's city').

It should be noted that even in the case of classes that do not imply the introduction of a participant at all, such as NATIONALITY or MATERIAL, the introduction of circumstants is nevertheless possible, cf.: `russkoye po dukhu proizvedeniye` 'a work Russian in spirit', `kirpichnoye so storony ulitsy ograzhdeniye` 'a brick fence on the street side'.

### 3.1.2.4. Change of Semantic Class due to the Introduction of a New Participant

When discussing complex prepositions, we already encountered the phenomenon where the addition of a new participant shifts an adjective from one semantic class to another. The addition of a prepositional phrase with `v otnoshenii` 'in relation to' to the adjectives `korrektnyy` 'correct' (EVALUATIVE) and `bezzabotnyy` 'carefree' (CHARACTER TRAITS AND HUMAN STATES) aligns these adjectives with adjectival lexemes containing an addressee valency, i.e., adjectives of the EMOTIONAL RELATION class. The basic lexical meaning of `korrektnyy` corresponds to 'correct, proper', and for `bezzabotnyy` - 'unburdened by care, worries'. When a prepositional phrase with `v otnoshenii` is added, the meaning of `korrektnyy` changes to 'fair with respect to X' (`korrektnyy v otnoshenii sopernikov` 'correct in relation to rivals'), and for `bezzabotnyy` - to 'indifferent to X' (`bezzabotny v otnoshenii chuzhikh zhizney` 'carefree with regard to others' lives').

Similar examples are observed in other classes. Thus, with the addition of a dative experiencer to the adjective `blizkiy` 'close', the latter transitions into the EVALUATIVE class:

(481) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
On yedinstvennyy blizkiy mne chelovek.
'He is the only person close to me.'

A similar situation occurs with the adjective `dorogoy` 'dear/expensive', which, already in the Old Russian language stage, alongside the meaning 'costly', also had the meaning 'one cherished, one loved', see (Sreznevskiy 1893: 720). The acquisition of such a new meaning is necessarily accompanied by (or, more precisely, implied by) the emergence of an optional semantic participant with the role of experiencer (`dorog komu` 'dear to whom').

* * *

To summarize the discussion of the problem of semantic participants of Russian adjectives and their encoding methods, we state the following. Firstly, as we have tried to show, the semantics (more precisely, belonging to a certain semantic class) of an adjective determines the set of its participants and (partially) the ways they are expressed. Secondly, there are participants characteristic of adjectives as a class of stative evaluative predicates in general, primarily the experiencer (and possibly some others). Thirdly, adjectives, like verbal predicates, are characterized by the expression of circumstants.

Individual adjectives often deviate from neat semantic classes with similar government (cf., for example, the idiosyncrasy of the dative participant, etc.). However, it can be said that the possibility of predicting the roles of an adjective's participants is determined more by its semantics than by the syntactic structure of the constituent it belongs to. The exception is the (hyper)role of the experiencer, universally defined by an applicative projection.

### 3.1.3. Syntactic Ranks of Participants and the Structure of the Adjective Phrase

Studies of argument structure (i.e., the set of semantic participants and their syntactic realization) are usually conducted on verbal lexemes. In a number of works, however, attempts have been made to study adjectival government, see (Jackendoff 1977; Cinque 1990; Bernstein 1995; Bennis 2004) et al. One of the first to draw attention to the ability of adjectives to attach their own complements was Otto Jespersen in (Jespersen 1937), see (Rincón 1987).

The discussion regarding the presence of a subject within the adjective phrase began during the development of X'-theory, see primarily (Jackendoff 1977; Stowell 1983). In (Stowell 1983), the possibility of a specifier existing in an adjectival projection was asserted, but only if such a projection was a small clause with a verb; Stowell denied the ability of (English) adjectives to independently license case. The ability of adjectives to project their own (subject) arguments was later recognized in (Stowell 1991; Bernstein 1995; Bennis 2004; Landau 2006) and some other works. The opposite viewpoint was expressed, for example, in (Baker 2003) and (MeltzerAsscher 2012).

The problem of the subject in the argument structure of adjectives is explicitly raised in (Hale, Keyser 2002; Baker 2003). Hale and Keyser suggest that adjectives, unlike verbs, lack the ability to project their own specifier, but can do so when they are part of a verbal predicate (see (483)).

<!-- image -->

Similar ideas were expressed by M. Baker. Baker raises the question that, for example, in the case of transitive verbs with two semantic participants (agent, patient), there is only one specifier position (Baker 2003: 83). Consequently, verbs that have a thematic argument (= patient) always have an abstract adjective in their structure, responsible for predicating its resulting state to the patient. The adjective phrase is included in the verbal projection:

(484) (Baker 2003: 81)

<!-- image -->

It should be noted that this observation perfectly resonates with a typologically widespread phenomenon such as complex predicates (see Iranian, Nakh-Dagestanian, and other languages). We will dedicate section 3.2 to the analysis of complex predicates.

Adjectives, according to Baker, are also unable to have their own specifier. According to Baker, this is their distinguishing feature as a lexical category: to act as a predicate, adjectives resort to the help of "syntactic predicates" – see, for example, the abstract linking head BE in the structure above.

One of the most well-known types of syntactic constructions with governing adjectives is the so-called "tough movement" (Chomsky 1981) et al. Predicative adjectives like `trudno` 'difficult' / `legko` 'easy' allow both impersonal usage and usage with an experiential participant as the subject:

(485) English (Jackendoff 1972: 227)
a. It is tough / easy to please John.
b. John is tough / easy to please.

The direct object of infinitives in constructions like (b) corresponds to the subject of the main nominal predication. In early generative works, it was assumed that the object of the infinitive clause raises to the subject position of the main clause. It was then proposed that John in example (b) is an argument of the adjective and controls a variable in the object position. Constructions of this type thus provide us with a possible example of adjectives having their own subject.

Linguists (almost?) do not dispute the existence of a direct object for adjectives. The following empirical fact seems extremely important to us: adjective complements are never marked with the accusative case, cf.:

(486) a. Ya znayu Petyu.
   I know Petya.ACC
   'I know Petya.'
b. Petya mne znakom / izvesten.
   Petya_NOM to.me_DAT familiar / known
   'Petya is familiar / known to me.'
b′. * Petya menya znakom / izvesten.
   Petya_NOM me_ACC familiar / known
   '*Petya is familiar / known me.'
b″. * Ya znakom / izvesten Petyu.
   I_NOM familiar / known Petya_ACC
   '*I am familiar / known Petya.'

(487) English
a. I like this car.
b. This car is good for me.
b′. * This car is good me.
b″. * I am good this car.

A possible exception to this can be found in some Germanic languages. For example, in German, the adjective `voll` 'full' is permissible with a nominative / accusative form. However, when adjectives are present (modifying the noun in the complement), genitive marking is required:

(488) German (E. A. Lyutikova, p.c.)
a. voll Wasser
   full water.N.SG.NOM/ACC
   'full of water'
b. voll heissen Wassers
   full hot.N.SG.GEN water.N.SG.GEN
   'full of hot water'

A cognate of the same adjective in Dutch can also be used without a preposition. Alternatively, use with a preposition is also possible:

(489) Dutch
a. De emmer was vol water.
   DEF bucket was full water
   'The bucket was full of water.'
b. een kamer vol met rook
   INDF room full with smoke
   'a room full of smoke'

Given, however, that morphological case has virtually disappeared in Dutch and accusative / dative are not actually distinguished, interpreting this as an example of accusative government is likely incorrect.

Such is the situation in languages where adjectives are distinguished as an independent category. The situation differs in languages where there are stative verbs corresponding to Russian or English adjectives, cf. examples from Vietnamese and Korean:

(490) Vietnamese (Van Ko 2015: 91)
a. Hắn nhát gan.
   he cowardly liver
   'He is timid (literally: "cowardly liver").'
b. Lão to gan.
   old.man big liver
   'The old man is brave.' (lit.: 'big liver')
c. Nó bẩn ở mũi.
   he dirty in nose
   'His nose is dirty.'

Vietnamese does not have morphological case. As can be seen from the last example, prepositional marking is in principle possible, but many adjectives (`tru_slivy_y` 'cowardly', `velikiy` 'great') attach unmarked noun phrases, similar to transitive verbs.

In Korean, stative predicates, in both predicative and attributive functions, can govern the accusative:

(491) Korean (E. L. Rudnitskaya, p.c.)
a. Sonyen-un apeci-lul talm-ass-ta.
   boy-TOP father-ACC resemble-RES-DECL
   'The boy resembles his father.'
b. Apeci-lul talm-un sonyen-I wus-ki sicakha-yess-ta.
   father-ACC resemble-PART boy-NOM laugh-NMN begin-PST-DECL
   'The boy resembling his father began to laugh.'

Predicative adjectives in Japanese form a subclass of verbs, whose second participant can receive nominative marking⁴⁰:

⁴⁰ Example and comments kindly provided by A. V. Kostyrkin.

(492) Japanese (A. V. Kostyrkin, p.c.)
Watashi wa inu ga kowa-i.
I TOP dog NOM afraid-PRES
'I am afraid of dogs.'

However, accusative government is sometimes possible:

(493) Japanese
Watashi wa inu o kowa-i.
I TOP dog ACC afraid-PRES
'I am afraid of dogs.'

We believe that the reasons for the absence of accusative marking in languages with an adjectival category and its presence in languages with statives lie in the different categorical affiliation of stems with the same semantics.

According to an idea known as "Burzio's generalization," the same functional projection, the so-called little v, is responsible for the insertion of the external argument and the assignment of accusative case, see (Burzio 1986). Little v is a projection of the head of the lexical verb V. The impossibility of accusative marking follows from the fact that an adjective cannot project little v. Consequently, there can be neither accusative case nor an external argument in the adjective's projection.

In (Cinque 1990), an attempt was made to transfer Burzio's idea of a multi-layered structure of the verb phrase to the material of the adjectival projection. Cinque subdivided adjectives into unergative and unaccusative (analogous to unaccusative verbs). Only unergative adjectives can license an external participant (Gianni):

(494) Italian (Cinque 1990: 2-3)
a. Gianni è certo / sicurro che verrò.
   Gianni_NOM COP sure / certain that I.will.come
   'Gianni is sure / certain that I will come.'
b. Che verrò è certo / sicurro.
   that I.will.come COP sure / certain
   'That I will come is sure / certain.'

Thus, it is assumed that the structure of unergative adjectives contains an aP projection level, responsible for the introduction of an external participant.

Following Cinque (1990), H. Bennis (2004) distinguishes two classes of adjectives in Dutch: unaccusative (e.g., `duidelijk` 'clear', `bekend` 'known') and unergative⁴¹ (`trouw` 'loyal', `verrassend` 'surprising').

⁴¹ The terminology for adjectives here slightly deviates from that for verbs: the term "unergative," historically preceding "unaccusative," roughly corresponds to it. The authors of works on adjectives wanted to make the terminology more distinctive.

The arguments of unaccusative adjectives attach within the lexical adjective phrase (AdjIn in the structure below):

(495) Dutch (Bennis 2004: 92)
[ AdjInP mij [ AdjIn' deze mensen [ AdjIn bekend ]]]
to.me these people known
'these people are known to me'

Unergative adjectives, on the contrary, are similar to unergative verbs: they attach their subjects in the specifier position of the light adjective head (AdjEx below):

(496) Dutch (Bennis 2004: 92)
[ AdjExP deze mensen [ AdjEx [ AdjIn mij [ AdjIn trouw ]]]]
these people to.me loyal
'these people are loyal to me'

The light (= small) adjective, according to Bennis, differs from the light (= small) verb in two properties: it does not assign case and allows only a stative (not dynamic) interpretation. The indirect object for both types of adjectives is located in the specifier of the lexical phrase.

The difference in the structure of various adjective types leads to different distribution rules. For example, in Dutch, unaccusative adjectives (`bekend` etc.) allow inversion, while unergative ones do not:

(497) Dutch (Bennis 2004: 93)
a. dat DIE JONGEN HEM / HEM DIE JONGEN bekend is
   that this boy to.him / to.him this boy known COP
   'that this boy is known to him'
b. dat DIE JONGEN HEM / * HEM DIE JONGEN trouw is
   that this boy to.him / * to.him this boy loyal COP
   'that this boy is loyal to him'

In (Stowell 1991), a multi-layered structure is also postulated for English adjectives; see also (Landau 2006) and other works. For example, a distinction is observed in the properties of mental adjectives (`clever`; `mean`) and subject-control adjectives (`eager`; `reluctant`):

(498) English (Stowell 1991: 106)
a. John was clever / mean to punish the dog.
b. It was clever / mean of John to punish the dog.

(499) English (Stowell 1991: 114)
a. Bill was eager / reluctant to punish the dog.
b. * It was eager / reluctant of Bill to punish the dog.

As suggested in (Stowell 1991), the participants of mental adjectives are generated as complements and can be introduced by a prepositional phrase with `of`. At the same time, adjectives like `eager` always have an external argument and, consequently, cannot take an `of`-complement. The participant expressed by an infinitive, according to Stowell, is actually a syntactic adjunct, see also (Kertz 2006).

Stowell also suggests that the introduction of eventive complements (infinitives) changes the semantic type of adjectives, transforming them from individual-level predicates into stage-level predicates, cf.: `Petya umnyy` 'Petya is smart' (CHARACTER TRAITS) and `Petya okazalsya dostatochno umen, chtoby nakazat' sobaku` 'Petya turned out to be smart enough to punish the dog' (HUMAN STATES, an actual manifestation of a certain quality – Petya might not be smart at all, but he had enough intelligence...). This approach develops the hypothesis proposed by A. Kratzer: eventive-level predicates differ from stage-level predicates precisely by the presence of an eventive argument, see (Kratzer 1995), but see also (Kertz 2006).

* * *

So, some researchers discuss the possibility of recognizing external shells of syntactic projection in adjectives. A universal feature appears to be the inability of adjectives to govern the accusative, which distinguishes them from verbs (including stative ones). It should also be noted that Russian adjectives are difficult to subdivide into those with external and internal participants.

### 3.1.4. Ability of Adjectives to Realize Arguments in Various Syntactic Functions

Adjectives can realize their valencies by functioning in a predicative role, as was the case in most of the examples above. In addition, various languages allow the expression of adjectival participants in attributive position and even when the adjective is used in a comparative construction.

Here are a few examples of the preservation of participants in comparative constructions:

(500) English (Internet)
The Sun looks bigger because it is closer [ to us ] than the stars.

(501) French (Internet)
C'était plus simple [ pour moi ] de m'installer en France.
it.was more simple [ for me ] to settle.INF in France
'It was simpler [for me] to settle in France.'

As can be understood from the Russian translations of the English and French examples, in Russian, adjectives in comparative function also retain their government.

Let us now turn to the attributive function – the most typologically "unstable" in terms of the possibility of realizing semantic participants. In some languages, attributive use of adjectives is absolutely natural, cf., for example, Russian:

(502) (Internet)
a. … mezhdu tem kak [ gordyy [ svoim umom ]] zrelyy chelovek, berya davayemoye yemu zhelezo, razlozhit yego na nesushchestvuyushchiye elementy i budet s vami sporit'.
   '…meanwhile, a mature person [proud [of his intellect]], taking the iron given to him, will break it down into non-existent elements and will argue with you.'
b. Kommentarii k foto navernyaka poradovali [ gorduyu [ svoim chadom ]] mat'.
   'The comments to the photo surely pleased the mother [proud [of her child]].'
c. Konechno, segodnya eti slova obrashcheny k samodovol'nomu i [ gordomu [ svoimi tekhnologicheskimi zavoyevaniyami ]] cheloveku.
   'Of course, today these words are addressed to a complacent person [proud [of his technological achievements]].'

Even some Turkic languages, whose adjectives are generally not very inclined to have valencies, sometimes demonstrate attributive use with dependents:

(503) Kyrgyz (Yudakhin 1985)
[[ mal kyshtat-uu-ga ] zhayluu ] zher
cattle winter-NMN-DAT good land
'a place suitable for wintering cattle'

(504) Kyrgyz (Internet)
[[ emchek emizgen eneler uchun ] zyiyanduu ] azyk-tar
breast feeding mothers for harmful product-PL
'products harmful for breastfeeding mothers'

We also provide examples from Germanic (German and Swedish) and Polish languages. Note that while in Turkic and Germanic examples the adjectival dependents are located to the left, in Russian, right-branching is natural in the adjective phrase:

(505) German (Cinque 2010: 45)
die [[ dem Mann ] treue ] Frau
DEF [[ DEF-DAT man ] loyal ] woman
'the wife loyal to her husband'

(506) Swedish (Cinque 2010: 45)
en [[ mig ] motbjudande ] tanke
DAT to.me disgusting thought
'a thought disgusting to me'

(507) Polish (Pysz 2008: 68)
dumna [ ze swej córki ] kobieta
proud [ of her daughter ] woman
'a woman proud of her daughter'

At the same time, English does not allow the expression of valencies in the attributive position. This regularity falls under the already known observation made by A. Holmberg and named the "Final-over-Final Constraint," see (Holmberg 2000). This constraint manifests in the fact that constituents with a final head can only embed other constituents with a final – but not initial! – head. Examples from Kyrgyz, German, and Swedish do not violate this constraint, as the adjectival dependents are located to the left.

The Final-over-Final constraint is relevant for English:

(508) English (Internet)
health-promotion programs [ appropriate [ for older people ]]

(509) English
[ appropriate [ for older people ]] health-promotion programs

(510) English (Internet)
food [ suitable [ for everyone ]]

(511) English
* suitable for everyone food

In (Biberauer et al. 2009), the Final-over-Final principle is explained using two postulates: R. Kayne's linear correspondence axiom and the rule of complements inheriting the tendency towards linearization. The linear correspondence axiom, see (Kayne 1994), prescribes a universal underlying structure order in all languages. Specifically, the complement must always follow the head. A particular language may require a surface linear order that is the reverse of the underlying one – in this case, linearization rules that move the complement to the left are invoked. According to (Biberauer et al. 2009), however, if the head of the matrix phrase requires linearization of the embedded constituent, then the embedded head must also linearize (= move to the left) its complement – see examples from Kyrgyz, German, and Swedish.

(Cinque 2010) provides examples from other languages in which, as in English, the constraint on the use of attributive prepositive adjectives with complements is relevant:

(512) Spanish (Cinque 2010: 45)
* los [ fáciles de resolver ] problemas
  DEF easy INF solve problem
  Expected: 'the problem easy to solve'

(513) Italian (Cinque 2010: 45)
* il [ simile ad un vocabolario ] libro
  DEF similar to INDF dictionary book
  Expected: 'the book similar to a dictionary'

Cinque explains the prohibition on attributive use with complements by the role of adjectives as the head of a functional projection. The complement position in this case is filled by lower functional projections, leaving no room for prepositional-case dependents.

The fact that the above-described constraint is violated in languages like Russian led some researchers to believe that it is not absolute but prioritizing. J. Hawkins suggested seeking the reasons for the undesirability of the "final-over-initial" arrangement (the case of Russian attributive adjectives with complements) in languages' tendency towards more economical parsing (Hawkins 1994).

Consider the following constructions with Russian adjectives:

(514) a. [[ podkhodyashchiye [ dlya lyudey starshego pokoleniya ]] programmy ]
   [[ suitable [ for people older generation ]] programs ]
   'programs suitable for older people'
a′. [ programmy, [ podkhodyashchiye [ dlya lyudey starshego pokoleniya ]]]
   [ programs, [ suitable [ for people older generation ]]]
   'programs, suitable for older people'
b. [[ prigodnaya [ vsem ]] pishcha ]
   [[ suitable [ to.all ]] food ]
   'food suitable for everyone'
b′. [ pishcha, [ prigodnaya [ vsem ]]]
   [ food, [ suitable [ to.all ]]]
   'food, suitable for everyone'

In the original examples, the recognition of the noun phrase occurs as follows: upon receiving the adjective (`prigodnaya` 'suitable'), the listener begins to wait for its syntactic "host" – the head noun (`pishcha` 'food'). This wait, however, is prolonged because the adjectival dependent (`vsem` 'to everyone') also needs to be analyzed. Such a strategy leads to excessive use of working memory and is uneconomical.

In the transformed examples with a prime (`[ pishcha, [ prigodnaya [ vsem ]]]`), this problem does not arise – the adjective directly follows the nominal head. The establishment of dependency is not linked to waiting during the recognition of the adjective's complement. Sequential postposition, therefore, is (like sequential preposition) a more efficient strategy.

The choice of parsing strategy is linked to the choice of a more or less efficient structure, rather than a universally possible or impossible one. The mechanism proposed by Hawkins is thus compatible with a situation of partial prohibition and better explains the grammaticality of attributive adjective complements in some languages and their ungrammaticality in others.

- On the other hand, following the same logic, it is difficult to explain the absolute prohibition on such structures in English – they would only be expected to be rarer. There is, however, one effect that speaks in favor of the parsing efficiency approach.

English and a number of other languages, see (Sheehan et al. 2017) and references therein, resort to extraposition of the adjectival complement to a post-nominal position.

(515) English (Sheehan et al. 2017: 132)
a. a difficult book [ for anyone to read ]
b. an easy book [ to persuade someone to read ]

(516) French (Internet)
C'etait une nouvelle information [ pour moi ] .
it.was a new information [ for me ]
'It was new information [for me].'

This is possible, however, only for individual-level adjectives; stage-level predicates are ungrammatical in such cases:

(517) English (Sheehan et al. 2017: 132)
a. * an anxious foreigner to make himself understood
b. * an aware child that there is a war

To summarize, the attributive position often hinders the expression of adjectival participants; compare, however, Russian, where (almost?) no such restrictions are present. A number of languages resort to postposition of the entire adjectival phrase (`pishcha, prigodnaya vsem` 'food, suitable for everyone'; `food suitable for everyone`). In some cases, even a non-projective strategy is chosen, consisting of placing the adjective phrase's complement after the nominal head (`suitable food for everyone`). The latter option, however, is limited. Along with the prohibition on moving dependents "over the head" of the nominal head for English stage-level adjectives, it can be said that Russian is generally not inclined to such a strategy, cf. `*prigodnaya pishcha vsem` '*suitable food to everyone', etc.

* * *

Adjectives can license their arguments in predicative position and in comparative constructions. As for the use of arguments in attributive function, languages differ significantly here. Some languages, such as Russian, do not have restrictions on the attributive use of arguments. In a number of other languages (e.g., English), adjectival arguments within a noun phrase cannot be expressed. The reasons for this may lie both in restrictions on syntactic structure and in a language's choice of a more preferred parsing strategy.

### 3.1.5. Realization of Arguments of Russian Adjectives

#### 3.1.5.1. Problem Statement

As we have seen above, adjectives in many languages can attach participants when functioning in a predicative role. As we will show, however, Russian hinders the surface expression of valencies in predicative APs. This behavior is somewhat unexpected, as the very fact of having an argument structure brings adjectives closer to verbs, for which the predicate function is natural.

In the previous sections, we established the following facts: i) Russian adjectives have various ways of encoding their semantic participants; ii) all adjectives in Russian can be divided into adjectival (Adjs) and attributive; iii) Adjs possess the maximally available set of adjectival properties (form short forms, comparatives, etc.), while attributives can only be a modifier within a noun phrase; iv) only Adjs are possible in the predicate position and as agreeing depictives; v) Adjs are in fact stative predicates – the possibility of licensing their own participants exists only for them, but not for attributives. Below, we will propose an analysis that explains the prohibition on the expression of semantic participants of Russian predicative APs.

Russian allows the placement of a prepositive attributive adjective or participle that has a right complement:

(518) (Internet)
Ugoshchat' [[ priyatnogo vam ] cheloveka ] blyudami sobstvennogo izgotovleniya - nesravnennoye udovol'stviye.
to.treat [[ pleasant to.you ] person ] dishes own making - incomparable pleasure
'Treating a person [pleasant [to you]] with homemade dishes is an incomparable pleasure.'
Pervaya lyubov' eto eyforiya, osnovannaya na chertakh [[ lyubimogo nami ] cheloveka ].
first love this euphoria, based on traits [[ loved by.us ] person ]
'First love is euphoria based on the traits of a person [loved [by us]].'

As we can see from the following examples, in Russian, adjective phrases with dependents that are grammatical in attributive position are inadmissible in predicative position:

(519) (Internet)
a. Opytnyy gipnotizer smozhet vvesti v gipnoz lyubogo soglasnogo na eto cheloveka.
   experienced hypnotist will.be.able to.introduce into hypnosis any agreeable to this person
   'An experienced hypnotist can hypnotize any person agreeable to this.'
b. Kazhdyy zhenatyy na inostranke muzhchina dolzhen dokazat', chto sposoben obespechit' zhenu.
   every married on foreigner man must prove, that able to.provide wife
   'Every man married to a foreigner must prove that he is able to provide for his wife.'
c. Ya dazhe ne znayu, gde mozhno nayti dovol'nuyu svoim rostom nizkuyu devushku.
   I even not know, where possible to.find satisfied with.her height short girl
   'I don't even know where one can find a short girl satisfied with her height.'

(520) a. * Chelovek byl soglasnyy na eto.
   * person was agreeable to this
   '*The person was agreeable to this.'
b. * Muzhchina byl zhenatyy na inostranke.
   * man was married on foreigner
   '*The man was married to a foreigner.'
c. * Devushka byla dovol'naya svoim rostom.
   * girl was satisfied with.her height
   '*The girl was satisfied with her height.'

The contrast between the behavior of predicative and attributive APs is unexpected both from a typological and a theoretical perspective. Typologically, the ability to license situational participants is more characteristic of units specified in a predicative function (verbs). From the perspective of theoretical syntax, explaining such a contrast is also difficult. For example, the "finite-after-finite" prohibition described in Chapter 2 predicts the ungrammaticality of attributive use and, conversely, does not exclude predicative use.

The short form (SF) of Russian adjectives in these contexts is predictably grammatical:
- (521) a. Chelovek byl soglasen na eto.
   person was agreeable.SF to this
   'The person was agreeable to this.'
- b. Muzhchina byl zhenat na inostranke.
   man was married.SF on foreigner
   'The man was married to a foreigner.'
- c. Devushka byla dovol'na svoim rostom.
   girl was satisfied.SF her height
   'The girl was satisfied with her height.'

The approaches proposed to explain the contrast between predicative and attributive APs are based on the idea of an adjective phrase hierarchy, at the core of which lies the SF projection, see (Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007; Borik 2014). In both works, it is proposed that the adjectival subject argument is its subject and occupies the specifier position of some internal projection. According to (Grashchenkov, Grashchenkova 2007), the ungrammaticality of predicative APs with complements is linked to a case conflict: case on a predicative AP cannot be assigned, because for this to happen, the subject noun phrase must move from the internal subject position to Spec, TP. We will further develop such an approach below.

In (Borik 2014), the prohibition on complements of predicative APs is explained as follows. Based on (Geist 2010), see also (Babby 1973; Babby 1985), Borik suggests that short adjectives have a verbal structure, including a subject argument:

(522) (Borik 2014: 153)
[ vsP DPi [ v s [√P &lt;i&gt;]]]

Indeed, the SF possesses number and gender features but lacks a case feature; see, however, (Babby 2009: 74-122), where the SF is associated with an inherent nominative. Full-form adjectives (PFs) containing arguments are formed by "building up" an additional functional shell responsible for case assignment. Borik uses the projection of the head `oj` as such an external shell, as proposed in (Halle, Matushansky 2006):

(523) (Borik 2014: 158)
<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The head of the internal projection `v` responsible for arguments can be stative in the case of adjectives (`vs`) or eventive in the case of participles (`ve`). Combining adjectives and participles within a single structure seems justified, as participles behave analogously to adjectives in this regard, cf.:

(524) (Internet)
Pervaya lyubov' eto eyforiya, osnovannaya na chertakh lyubimogo nami cheloveka.
first love this euphoria, based on traits loved by.us person
'First love is euphoria based on the traits of a person loved by us.'

(525) * Etot chelovek byl lyubimyy mnoy.
   * this man was loved by.me
   '*This man was loved by me.'

According to (Borik 2014), the reason for the prohibition on the predicative use of PFs with complements is the absence of a case feature on nominal predicates in the predicative position. However, this analysis raises several questions. Firstly, it is not entirely clear why PFs without complements are grammatical. The case feature is equally critical for their derivation, and if it is absent in the predicative position, then predicative PFs should also be impossible, which contradicts the facts:

(526) Ona byla umnaya / ustavshaya…
   she was smart / tired
   'She was smart / tired…'

Secondly, the case feature in simple predication with a nominative is actually present; its source is the nominative of the subject. This is evidenced by the facts of the distribution of the agreeing PF in infinitives discussed above. In cases where T cannot assign nominative case, the predicative PF is possible only in the instrumental, but not in the nominative:

(527) (Internet)
a. Ty prosto khotel byt' schastlivym.
   you simply wanted to.be happy.INST
   'You simply wanted to be happy.'
b. Byt' zdorovym - obyazannost' kazhdogo.
   to.be healthy.INST - duty of.everyone
   'To be healthy is everyone's duty.'

(528) a. * Ty prosto khotel byt' schastlivyy.
   * you simply wanted to.be happy.NOM
   '*You simply wanted to be happy.'
b. * Byt' zdorovyy - obyazannost' kazhdogo.
   * to.be healthy.NOM - duty of.everyone
   '*To be healthy is everyone's duty.'

Due to the absence of a case feature on the infinitive, the use of the nominative form of the copula is impossible. An adjective in nominal predication can only be in the instrumental.

Thirdly, an analysis that assumes the absence of case in agreeing PFs cannot explain other contexts of their use with complements. In reality, the use of an adjective with a complement is permissible in various syntactic contexts outside of attributive use. Adjective phrases functioning as depictives appear somewhat more grammatical:

(529) (Internet)
a. ? Cherez 4 mesyatsa muzh vernulsya [ soglasnyy na vse ]…
   ? after 4 months husband returned [ agreeable to everything ]
   '?After 4 months the husband returned [agreeable to everything]…'
b. ? Uyekhal nash Sotskiy v svoy Ovruch normal'nyy, a priyekhal [ zhenatyy na svoyey Gene ].
   ? left our Sotsky to his Ovruch normal, but arrived [ married to his Gena ]
   '?Our Sotsky left for his Ovruch normal, but arrived [married to his Gena].'
c. ? Ya prishla domoy [ dovol'naya svoimi pokupkami ].
   ? I came home [ satisfied with.my purchases ]
   '?I came home [satisfied with my purchases].'

Adjective phrases with complements as appositive clauses appear absolutely acceptable:

(530) (Internet)
a. [ Soglasnyy na lyubuyu formu zarabotka ], on, v kontse kontsov, prinimayet vse trebovaniya…
   [ agreeable to any form of.earning ], he, in end of.ends, accepts all demands
   '[Agreeable to any form of earning], he, in the end, accepts all demands…'
b. Odnazhdy k Akhmatovoy priyekhal slavist-anglichanin, [ zhenatyy na russkoy iz pervoy emigratsii ].
   one.day to Akhmatova arrived slavist-Englishman, [ married to Russian from first emigration ]
   'One day, an English Slavist arrived at Akhmatova’s, [married to a Russian from the first emigration].'
c. [ Dovol'naya uspekhom ], ona skrylas' v nochi.
   [ satisfied with.success ], she disappeared in night
   '[Satisfied with her success], she disappeared into the night.'

Fourthly, an adjective with a complement occurs in predicative and depictive instrumental constructions, where its grammaticality appears somewhat (but not absolutely) reduced:

(531) (Internet)
a. ?… do etogo vladimirtsy byli [ soglasnymi na nasiliye ], a seychas vot otkazhutsya…
   ?… before this residents.of.Vladimir were [ agreeable.INST to violence ], but now will.refuse
   '?… before this, the residents of Vladimir were [agreeable to violence], but now they will refuse…'
b. ? Leksus byl [ zhenatym na kakoy-to sterve ], kotoruyu sovsem ne lyubit…
   ? Lexus was [ married.INST to some bitch ], whom completely not loves
   '?Lexus was [married to some bitch], whom he doesn't love at all…'
c. ? Do rodov ya byla [ dovol'noy svoim telom ]…
   ? before birth I was [ satisfied.INST with.my body ]
   '?Before childbirth I was [satisfied with my body]…'

(532) (Internet)
a. ? Kryl'ya Sovetov s samogo startovogo svistka ne vyglyadeli [ soglasnymi na seriyu penal'ti ].
   ? Krylya Sovetov from very start whistle not looked [ agreeable.INST to series penalties ]
   '?Krylya Sovetov from the very starting whistle did not look [agreeable to a penalty shootout].'
b. ? V Parizh Roshfor vernulsya [ zhenatym na pol'ke ].
   ? to Paris Rochefort returned [ married.INST to Pole.F ]
   '?Rochefort returned to Paris [married to a Polish woman].'
c. ? V itoge ya priyekhala stroyenoy, schastlivoy i [ dovol'noy soboy ]!
   ? in result I arrived slim, happy and [ satisfied.INST with.myself ]
   '?In the end, I arrived slim, happy, and [satisfied with myself]!'

Finally, fifth, the argument we presented above is related to derivational morphology. A number of Russian adjectival lexemes are associated with the absence of a full form (PF): `rad` ('glad'), `prav` ('right'), `velik` ('great' in size). Abstract nouns `radost'` ('gladness'), `pravota` ('rightness'), `velichina` ('magnitude') are formed rather by morphology specified for adjectives, not by derivational morphemes encoding the transition of verbs to nouns.

Thus, an analysis based on the opposition of SF and PF as belonging to different grammatical classes and postulating the absence of a case feature in predicative PFs does not explain the following phenomena: i) the permissibility of predicative PFs without a complement; ii) the ungrammaticality of PFs with a complement as part of an infinitive; iii) the (relative) grammaticality of secondary predication and appositive clauses with a complement; iv) the (relative) grammaticality of predicative and depictive instrumental PFs with a complement; v) the morphological affiliation of SFs to adjectives, not verbs.

Below, we will explain the reasons for the unacceptability of predicative PFs with a complement, as well as why such adjective phrases are possible in a number of contexts, but their grammaticality is reduced.

### 3.1.5.2. SFs and PFs with complements in predicative position

Let us recall the reasons we established for the ungrammaticality of full-form adjectives (Adjs) in predicative use. In the section dedicated to Russian predicative APs, we concluded that only attributive APs devoid of internal structure can form nominal predication. There are two reasons for the ungrammaticality of Adjs: i) a "delay" in assigning case to the adjective, and ii) two identical semantic roles (one from the Adj head, the other from the Pred head).

Such problems do not arise in the case of SFs. The Russian SF shares with the verb the ability to project its own arguments. As we established, in Russian, there are no adjectives capable of taking a complement and not having an SF. This indicates that adjective arguments are a property of some minimal lexical unit, Adj, which, according to our terminology, forms Adjs. Above the SF head and embedded within it,

(533) structure of predication with an SF having a dependent
<!-- image -->

the `res` head dominates TP, not Pred – thus, duplication of (the same) semantic role does not occur. The SF also does not contain a case feature, so there is no problem with case assignment either. Let us repeat the structure of the predicative SF with a complement (533).

We have shown why the presence of complements makes the PF ungrammatical and why the SF with complements remains grammatical in this case. Let us now consider the structure of PFs with complements in attributive position.

### 3.1.5.3. PFs with complements in attributive position

The noun-modifying use of adjectives with complements is also possible in postpositive position:

(534) (Internet)
a. Tserkovnomu suyeveriyu… ono protivopostavilo… samosoznaniye cheloveka, gordogo svoimi lichnymi dostoinstvami.
   church superstition.DAT… it opposed… self-awareness person.GEN, proud.GEN his personal merits.INST
   '…it opposed church superstition… with the self-awareness of a person [proud of his personal merits].'
b. V kazhdoy knige, interesnoy podrostkam, opisyvayetsya lyubov' i otnosheniya.
   in every book, interesting.DAT adolescents.DAT, described love and relations
   'In every book [interesting to teenagers], love and relationships are described.'
c. Narisuy devushku, dovol'nuyu svoim vesom.
   draw girl.ACC, satisfied.ACC her weight.INST
   'Draw a girl [satisfied with her weight].'

Note that such uses are not always accompanied by pause, see, for example, (Grashchenkov et al. 2018). Consequently, postpositive adjective phrases do not necessarily imply a separate appositive structure. Single adjectives without intonational highlighting are impossible⁴²:

(535) a. * Etomu protivopostavleno samosoznaniye cheloveka umnogo.
   * to.this opposed self-awareness person.GEN smart.GEN
   '*To this is opposed the self-awareness of a smart person.'
b. * Kniga staraya opisyvayet lyubov'.
   * book old describes love
   '*An old book describes love.'
c. * Narisuy devushku nizkuyu.
   * draw girl.ACC short.ACC
   '*Draw a short girl.'

⁴² Such noun phrases become grammatical with a rising tone on the adjective or with a specific meaning of the noun phrase (`romashka obyknovennaya` 'common daisy') – in this case, we are dealing with adjectival inversion, see (Lyutikova 2012).

We propose that the use of attributive adjectives with a complement involves the following structure, see also (Babby 1973; Kayne 1994) et al.:

(536)
<!-- image -->

Besides factors related to the internal structure of the noun phrase, the necessity of a postpositive stage in the derivation of the noun phrase is supported by the ability of adjectival subject participants to bind reflexive and reciprocal pronouns:

(537) (Internet) Daler vsegda v dvizhenii i postoyanno menyayetsya, on samyy [ trebovatel'nyy k samomu sebe i ] chelovek i…
   Daler always in movement and constantly changes, he most [ demanding to self himself i ] person i…
   'Daler is always moving and constantly changing, he is the most [demanding of himself i ] person i…'

(538) (Internet)
Eti dva [ pokhozhikh drug na druga i ] cheloveka i stali luchshimi druz'yami na vsyu zhizn'.
these two [ similar.GEN each to other i ] people i became best friends for whole life
'These two people [similar to each other i ] became best friends for life.'

As we can see, the local reflexive `samogo sebya` and the reciprocal pronoun `drug druga` linearly precede the noun phrases to which they refer. For internal subjects to bind these anaphors, the subject noun phrases must c-command the anaphors at some stage of derivation. It is precisely such a structure that we have presented above.

Next, the `adjP` phrase moves left from `NP` to a position where agreeing modifiers are usually located. After all functional projections are attached within the noun phrase, the features of gender, number, and case will be assigned to the adjective:

(539)
<!-- image -->

Thus, in the case of an attributive AP with dependents, the adjective phrase does not leave the boundaries of the DP, which is its subject. Problems with case assignment and a "redundant" semantic role do not arise. For the same reason, appositive clauses, which, as we established, are also located within the DP to which they refer, are grammatical.

Within the framework of our formulated approach to the adjective phrase, we have justified the structure underlying the attributive and appositive use of adjectives with dependents. Next, we will analyze cases of predicative instrumental and secondary predication.

### 3.1.5.4. Predicative instrumental and secondary predication with a complement

The case of the predicative instrumental differs from agreeing nominal predication in that the Pred head assigns case. This eliminates one of the two reasons for ungrammaticality – the absence of a case feature on the adjective PF. The second factor of ungrammaticality – the duplication of the semantic role – remains. This situation fully corresponds to the partial grammaticality of the predicative instrumental that we observe. Its use is better than the use of the agreeing PF, but not absolutely grammatical.

The same applies precisely to the case of the depictive instrumental. The reasons and degree of its ungrammaticality are exactly the same as for the predicative instrumental.

We are left to examine the case of the agreeing depictive, which also occurs but also has reduced grammaticality. As we established when discussing the structure of Russian agreeing depictives, in this case, we have before us not a Pred, but an adjective phrase. However, the case of agreeing depictives, as we again established above, represents a case of so-called dependent case. Consequently, one of the two factors of ungrammaticality is again present, this time related to case.

* * *

The geometry of ungrammaticality factors and possible structures is as follows:

(540)
| Context                                        | Case | Role | Example                                                                                                  |

### 3.1.6. Adjective Participants and Their Expression: Summary

As we have seen, in languages with a developed adjectival category, adjectives are capable of licensing a whole range of participants. The most regular ones are the subject of evaluation, benefactive / stimulus, participants in symmetric situations, and sentential actants. The means of encoding such participants are also extremely diverse, both in Russian and from a typological perspective. Dative marking is most common; prepositional and postpositional phrases are also regularly found, etc. Due to the fact that adjectives do not form an extended verbal projection, they cannot assign accusative case to their dependents. This rule appears to be true in all languages where adjectives form a separate category and are not stative verbal predicates.

Furthermore, in various languages, there are local configurations specific to them that hinder the expression of arguments. Thus, in English, the expression of adjectival participants in attributive function is impossible, and in Russian, it is impossible in predicative function. At the same time, the ability to license situational participants (= the presence of an argument structure) appears to be typologically characteristic of adjectives and their analogues - stative predicates.

By analyzing the use of Russian adjectives with complements, we have explained a number of prohibitions – of varying degrees of strictness – on the expression of participants in predicative PFs. We have come to an important conclusion that Russian adjectives have a subject participant in their argument structure. Such structures, projected by the adjectival head Adj, also possess the ability to express participants of other semantic types. The conclusion about the possibility of an adjective projecting a subject participant will be confirmed by the material in the next section.

## 3.2. Adjectives in the Lexical Structure of the Verb: Ossetian Complex Predicates⁴³

### 3.2.1. Complex Predicates

This section will be dedicated to the interaction of verbal and adjectival lexemes. We will thoroughly investigate the integration of an adjectival stem into the lexical structure of the verb. As we will see, the argument structure of the verb can be represented as a composition of adjectival and verbal structures. The material for this study will be so-called complex predicates (CPs) – a special type of lexeme attested in various languages of the world.

Complex predicates in Ossetian and other languages of the world where they are present provide an opportunity to "look inside" the lexical structure of the verb and the verb phrase. Elements of verb structure that can only be guessed at when studying English or Russian become visible to the naked eye when examining languages with complex predicates.

⁴³ The main linguistic material for this section was collected during the linguistic expeditions of the Department of Theoretical and Applied Linguistics of Moscow State University (OTiPLa MSU) in 2008-2010 to Dargavs village of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania. The author expresses deep gratitude to all participants of the OTiPLa expeditions in 2008-2010, as well as, naturally, to all residents and teachers of Dargavs village for their assistance and support. Some Ossetian data was found online; in such cases, the example will be marked accordingly. For more details on the data collection method, see (Grashchenkov et al. 2011).

Iranian languages have constructions that we will henceforth call "complex predicates" (CPs), cf. "compound verbal predicate" (Akhvlediani 1969: 104), "complex or compound verbs" (Bagayev 1965: 270). As indicated in various works on CP typology, many meanings traditionally conveyed by verbs in European or other languages of the world are expressed in Iranian languages by a construction including an auxiliary (or light) verb and a nominal item:

(541) Kurdish (Haig 2002)
Ferho dest-ê mel-ê maç kir.
Ferho hand-M mullah-OBL kiss did
'Ferho kissed the mullah's hand.'

In the Kurdish example, the nominal item (NI) is represented by the noun 'kiss', and the verbal part (hereinafter LV, from "light verb") by the verbal lexeme 'do'. It appears that world languages more often resort to using nouns as the nominal item. In Iranian languages (see the Kurdish example above), nouns are more commonly used as NIs, although CPs can also be formed with units from other lexical categories. In addition, an example from Basque can also be given, where nouns are (practically) the only possible NI option:

(542) Basque (N. Madaryaga, p.c.)
a. Ikerr-ek korrika egiten du goizetan.
   Iker-ERG run do.IPF AUX.3.SG.ERG mornings
   'Iker runs in the mornings.'
b. Ivan-ek domenistiku egin du.
   Ivan-ERG sneeze do AUX.3.SG.ERG
   'Ivan sneezed.'
c. Paxa-k Saxa-ri dei egin dio.
   Pasha-ERG Sasha-DAT call do AUX.3.SG.DAT.3.SG.ERG
   'Pasha called Sasha.'

The provided Basque examples consist of an NI-noun and represent unergative CPs. As we will see below, CPs can also form unaccusative and transitive lexemes.

CPs must be distinguished from other types of constructions with verbs, primarily from verbal complexes that specify aspectual-temporal and other grammatical meanings, cf. the permissive example from (Butt 1995):

(543) Urdu (Butt 1995: 35)
Anjum-ne saddaf-ko jaa-ne di-yaa.
Anjum.F-ERG Saddaf.F-DAT go-INF.OBL give-PFCT.M.SG
'Anjum allowed Saddaf to leave.'

In this Urdu example, the verb 'give' corresponds to a permissive modal meaning. Another type of verbal constructions that must be distinguished from CPs are constructions with so-called serial verbs, exemplified below by an example from Bengali:

(544) Bengali (Butt, Lahiri 2013)
Ram eʃe por-l-o.
Ram.NOM come fall-PST-3
'Ram arrived.'

In serial constructions, two verbs are combined, together specifying a certain action. In the Bengali example above, the addition of the verb 'fall' to the verb 'come' brings in a resultative meaning, lit.: 'having come, fell' = 'arrived, appeared'.

CPs differ from the given examples both structurally and functionally, and represent a typologically regular construction. For instance, CPs in Korean, genetically unrelated to Iranian languages, are organized analogously to Iranian ones. In the example below, the CP 'analyze' contains the LV 'do' and the NI 'analysis':

(545) Korean (Park 2007)
John-i teita-lul pwunsek ha-ess-ta.
John-NOM data-ACC analysis do.PST-DEC
'John analyzed the data.'

Denominal CPs in Urdu (Indic) are formed by the same rules: the CP 'remember' contains the LV 'do' and the NI 'memory':

(546) Urdu (Ahmed, Butt 2011)
Nadya-ne kahani yad k-i.
Nadya.F.SG-ERG story.F.SG.NOM memory do-PFCT.F.SG
'Nadya remembers (this) story.'

A functional feature of CPs is that both parts of the predicate convey a single situation, and the NI and LV distribute between them the expression of individual aspects of the lexical meaning specified by the CP.

A characteristic example of CPs in Iranian languages is Modern Persian:

(547) Persian (Megerdoomian 2001: 102)
a. Mani dær-ro baz-kærd.
   Mani door-ACC open-do.PAST.3.SG
   'Mani opened the door.'
b. Dær baz-šod.
   door open-become.PAST.3.SG
   'The door opened.'

According to (Karimi 2008), in Modern Persian, there are slightly over one hundred "ordinary" verbal lexemes; the rest of the verbal lexicon consists of complex predicates. S. Karimi (Ibid.) indicates that the process of verbs being displaced by complex predicates occurred in Iranian languages since the 10th century, and according to (Folli et al. 2005: 7) for Persian, since the 13th century.

Approximate calculations of the ratio of verbal lexemes and CPs in the (Ossetian-Russian Dictionary 1970) show an approximate equality of entries for verbal lexemes and complex predicates. This, of course, does not indicate equal frequency of word forms – it seems that verbal lexemes are more common among frequent predicative vocabulary, and in actual usage, they occur more often than complex predicates. Nevertheless, it can be asserted that in Ossetian, complex predicates constitute a significant part of the lexicon and often encode verbal meanings from the basic vocabulary. An important distinction for us between Ossetian and other (Iranian) languages is that a significant part of complex predicates here are formed by adjectives.

The distributional features of CPs in Ossetian have been described in great detail, see (Gagkayev 1952: 80-81; 1956: 56-59; Bagayev 1965: 269-271; Akhvlediani 1969: 104-109) et al. In (Abayev 1970), in particular, we find: "Compound verbs consist of a nominal part and the auxiliary verb `kænym` 'to do' (sometimes also `lasyn` 'to drag') or `uyn` 'to be'. Many actions and states that are expressed by simple verbs in Russian are expressed by compound ones in Ossetian" (Ibid.: 638).

Below, we will present a detailed description of how the nominal and verbal parts of a complex predicate interact and how this interaction is reflected in the argument structure of the resulting verbal lexeme. We will be particularly interested in the following questions: i) what determines the single argument of intransitive CPs; ii) what determines the arguments of transitive CPs; iii) more broadly – how the lexical meaning of the resulting CP depends on its constituent NI and LV.

We will begin by analyzing the concept of lexical decomposition, developed within the generative approach to language, see (Hoekstra 2004; Hale, Keyser 1993; 1997; 1998; 2002; Ramchand 2008; Folli et al. 2005; Karimi-Doostan 2004). Note that the latter two works are based on data from Iranian languages. Some other works important to us, primarily (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013), will be considered as the material is analyzed.

### 3.2.2. Complex Predicates and the Theory of Lexical Decomposition

Among the first to propose an approach in the spirit of lexical decomposition were K. Hale and S. Keyser. In their 1993 work, they put forward the idea of Lexical Argument (or Relational) Structure, which they subsequently developed. According to this idea, compositional analysis is applicable already at the level of (verbal) lexemes. Thus, in a number of cases, a verb can take a verb phrase as a complement:

(548) (Hale, Keyser 1993: 69)
<!-- image -->

There would be nothing surprising in (548) were it not for the fact that the entire V′ projection is "placed inside" the verbal lexeme and phonologically represents an ordinary verbal word form. In the case of verbs like `to clear` and similar ones, the verb phrase contains an adjective whose subject can be – with the participation of some abstract verbal head – a noun phrase undergoing a transition to a new state:

(549) English (Hale, Keyser 1998: 12)
The screen cleared.

The argument structure of this sentence is as follows:

(550) (Hale, Keyser 1998: 13)
<!-- image -->

As can be seen from structure (550), the verb `to clear` is based on an adjectival lexeme. Along with the cases described, there are also examples like (551):

(551) English (Hale, Keyser 1998: 12)
I cleared the screen.

In this case, another event is built upon the event specified by the adjective, an event which is specified by another abstract verbal head responsible for introducing an external argument – the agent – into the argument structure:

(552) (Hale, Keyser 1998: 14)
<!-- image -->

Thus, `the screen` in both cases is the internal "subject" of the event related to the adjective, which can be elaborated if there is a need to specify the causer of the situation 'to be clean'.

The external (active, causing) participant, according to the proposed approach, is associated with some abstract verbal head, and not with the resulting state, which can be specified by adjectival lexemes.

According to Hale and Keyser's theory, verbs based on nouns behave differently. They do not, in particular, allow alternation related to the addition of an external causer to the argument structure:

(553) English (Hale, Keyser 1993: 74)
a. The clown laughed.
b. * The clown laughed the child.

This prohibition is due to the fact that nouns (as part of verbal projections) cannot even indirectly license their arguments. For argument insertion, they need a verb that "knows how" to do it. In other words, when we form verbs from noun stems, we already take V′ as an abstract head. In this case, a monadic predication approximately corresponds to the meaning 'The child made / produced a sound.' The formation of a transitive situation (in languages without morphological causatives) is impossible in this case.

It follows from Hale and Keyser's system, in particular, that deadjectival verbs correspond to unaccusatives, as they can do without the upper level of the V′ projection. They can undergo causative-inchoative alternation. At the same time, denominal verbs correspond to unergatives and cannot alternate – they always have a V′ containing an external argument.

The theory of lexical decomposition has been actively refined over the last twenty years, see, for example, the works of T. Hoekstra (Hoekstra 2004). Currently, the approach in the spirit of lexical decomposition has been most consistently developed in the work of G. Ramchand (Ramchand 2008). Let us present the main principles of decomposational analysis proposed by Ramchand.

Ramchand identifies three universal levels of projection – `init`, `proc`, `res` – from which each verbal lexeme is composed. The highest level, `init`, corresponds to the initiation of a situation and specifies its causer. At the next level, `proc`, which determines the characteristics of the process denoted by the verb, the undergoer participant is specified. The third, deepest level of embedding, `res`, specifies the final state into which the undergoer will transition. Individual verbs may or may not have corresponding projection levels. Thanks to various combinations of the verb's internal components and semantic roles, the full range of observed argument structure variants is obtained.

Simplifying Ramchand's approach somewhat, one can say that the causer level in her analysis corresponds to the abstract verbal head that licenses the external participant in Hale and Keyser's system. At the same time, the result projection (`resP`) is responsible for the resulting state in Ramchand's system, while in Hale and Keyser's, it is an adjective that is a complement of the verbal projection. Causative-inchoative alternation like 'Agent cleared Undergoer' (`agens sdelal preterpevayushcheye chistym` 'agent made the undergoer clean') vs. 'Undergoer cleared' (`preterpevayushcheye stalo chistym` 'undergoer became clean') is described by Ramchand in the same way as by her predecessors: by omitting or adding a causative subevent.

It can be said that Ramchand's system is a development of Hale and Keyser's ideas. In turn, a development of Ramchand's theory applied to Iranian languages is the work (Pantcheva 2008), where each functional projection from Ramchand's system (`init`, `proc`, `res`) is mapped to a specific use of the LV.

In (Folli et al. 2005), see also the references therein, a decompositional approach based on material from Modern Persian is proposed. As a result of a detailed analysis of Persian complex predicates, the authors conclude that the causing participant is specified by the light verb, as are eventive vs. stative interpretation and duration of action. At the same time, telicity is determined by the type of NI – nouns participate in the formation of atelic CPs, while other parts of speech participate in the formation of telic ones. The latter result is disputed in (Megerdoomian 2001), where it is argued that LVs also influence the aspectual structure of CPs. The thesis about the dependence of the external argument (only) on the light verb was disputed in (Karimi-Doostan 2004).

Before proceeding to a detailed analysis of CPs in Ossetian, let us describe the main differences between Ossetian CPs and CPs in other Iranian languages. These are: i) the lexical composition of light verbs is much more restricted; ii) the productivity of constructions with adjectives is higher; iii) the rules of surface syntax for CPs in Ossetian are more rigid.

The latter two facts will be the focus of further research; here, let us briefly mention point i). In Ossetian, a diachronic restructuring of the LV system is clearly observed – it transitions from lexical diversity in the area of auxiliary verbal units to a system of two verbs, 'be' and 'do'. In other Iranian languages, CPs are regularly formed with the participation of verbs like 'give', 'take', 'come', 'fall', etc., see (Haig 2002) for Kurdish or (Pantcheva 2008) for Persian, for example:

(554) Persian (Pantcheva 2008: 149)
a. Reza mina-ra hol dad.
   Reza Mina-ACC push give
   'Reza pushed Mina.'
b. Ye entefaq rui dad.
   ART incident face give
   'An incident happened.'

In modern Ossetian, almost all CPs are served by the LVs 'be' and 'do'; thus, the (Ossetian-Russian Dictionary 1970) notes about 60 cases of variation between the verb `lasyn` '(re)move, take off' and `kænym`, for example: `agæpp kænym` (`lasyn`) 'to jump', etc. Below, we will consider only examples of CPs with 'be' and 'do'.

### 3.2.3. Morphosyntax of Ossetian Complex Predicates

Prefixation. Below, we will primarily be interested in prefixes that turn CPs into perfective verbs – they constitute the overwhelming majority in Ossetian. The ability to place a prefix on the NI distinguishes CPs from ordinary combinations of lexical verbs with nominal word forms (in constructions like "copula + complement of nominal predication," "verb + direct object," etc.). This property of CPs has been repeatedly noted by researchers of the Ossetian language: "The possibility of extracting the preverb 'outside the parentheses' and attaching it to the nominal part represents an important feature of compound verbs, distinguishing them from ordinary verb-complement combinations. Thus, from `art kænym` 'to make fire' one can say `sart kodta` 'he made fire', but for `kærdzyn kænym` 'to make bread' one does not say `skærdzyn kodta`, but rather `kærdzyn skodta`, because `art kænym` is a compound verb, and `kærdzyn kænym` is a free combination" (Abayev 1970: 640). Let us give our own examples:

(555) Ossetian
a. Ӕz a-lyg kodton dzul.
   I PREF-cut LV.PST.1.SG⁴⁴ bread
   'I cut the bread.'
b. Ӕz fæ-rynchyn dæn.
   I PREF-sick LV.PRES.1.SG
   'I became sick.'
c. Bækh a-gæpp kodta.
   horse PREF-jump LV.PST.3.SG
   'The horse jumped.'

The examples above demonstrate prefixed NIs: with a transitive verb (a), an unaccusative verb (b), and an unergative verb (c). However, prefixes can also be placed on the LV. In (Abayev 1970: 640) we find: "However, the attachment of the preverb to the verbal part is also possible. This happens when the nominal part carries logical stress: instead of `næ dæ ferokh kodton` 'I didn't forget you', one can say `rokh dæ næ fækodton` 'I didn't forget you', with logical stress on `rokh`."

In our examples above, the LVs (and not the NIs) can also be supplied with prefixes:

(556) Ossetian
a. Ӕz lyg a-kodton dzul.
   I cut PREF-LV.PST.1.SG bread
   'I cut the bread.'
b. Ӕz rynchyn fæ-dæn.
   I sick PREF-LV.PRES.1.SG
   'I became sick.'
c. Bækh gæpp a-kodta.
   horse jump PREF-LV.PST.3.SG
   'The horse jumped.'

⁴⁴ Here and further, we will gloss LV as LV (Light Verb) if the type of LV is irrelevant.
⁴⁵ The direct object of inanimate nouns in Ossetian is encoded with the nominative case.

Prefixing the nominal item is indeed impossible when the verb `делать` ('to do') is used lexically (i.e., when it is not used as an LV), see V. I. Abayev’s statement above:

(557) Ossetian
a. * Ciutæ s-akhston kodtoy.
   birds PREF-nest do.PST.3.PL
   '*The birds PREF-nested.'
b. Ciutæ akhston s-kodtoy.
   birds nest PREF-do.PST.3.PL
   'The birds built a nest.'

This property – the ability to attach a prefix to the NI – will be considered a diagnostic feature of complex predicates, cf.: "A sign of whether these words are auxiliary verbs or not is the possibility of using verbal prefixes (`a-`, `ra-`, `ba-`, etc.) with the nominal part," see (Bagayev 1965: 271).

Prefixation is noteworthy for another property, which, like unified stress (see below), allows us to speak of CPs as a single lexeme.⁴⁶ Regardless of where exactly (NI or LV) the prefix is located, the type of prefix is always determined by the NI. Thus, for the following CPs in the first column, only the prefixed forms in the last column are characteristic:

(558) Ossetian (Ossetian-Russian Dictionary 1970)

| Verb        | Meaning     | Verb with prefix                                               |
| :---------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fynæy kænyn` | 'to sleep'  | `ær-fynæy`, `a-fynæy`, `ba-fynæy`, `nyff-fynæy kænyn`          |
| `khqarm kænyn` | 'to warm'   | `ærba-khqarm`, `ær-khqarm`, `a-khqarm`, `s-khqarm kænyn`       |
| `rokh kænyn`  | 'to forget' | `ay-rokh`, `bay-rokh kænyn`                                    |

⁴⁶ This observation was suggested to the author by S. G. Tatevosov, cf. also: "Each noun or predicative member has, so to speak, one or several favored prefixes with which they constantly combine. For example: 1) `arfæ kænyn` 'to thank' combines only with prefixes `fæ-`, `ra-`: `raarfæ`, `færfæ kænyn` 'to thank', 'to reciprocate thanks'; 2) `Iu kænyn` 'to connect' combines with prefixes `ba-`, `ærba-`: `baiu`, `ærbaiu kænyn` 'to connect', 'to unite'..." (Gagkayev 1956: 57).

In the case of LV prefixation, the form of the prefix remains the same: `fynæy ba-kænyn`, but not *`fynæy s-kænyn`; `khqarm s-kænyn`, but not *`khq-arm nyk-kænyn`, `rokh a-kænyn`, but not *`rokh ær-kænyn`. Thus, the form of the prefix, characterizing the action of the entire CP, is selected by the nominal item.

**Stress.** From the perspective of stress placement, CPs behave as a single unit: "In their initial form (infinitive), compound verbs are pronounced with a single stress" (Bagayev 1965: 271). And further from N. K. Bagayev: "In personal forms of imperfective compound verbs, stress can fall on either the nominal part or the auxiliary verb, if logical stress does not fall on the predicate verb. For example: `Sqoladzau akhuyr kæny yæ uroktæ` 'The student studies his lessons'... In many perfective forms, there is only one stress, which usually falls on the nominal part when the verbal prefix is added to the nominal part preceding the auxiliary verb. For example: `Adæmy uynæræy æmæ tamakoyi tæfæy baydazag is dærghætsston zal` (Gæd. Ts., Fydælty namys) 'The oblong hall was filled with the noise of people and the smell of tobacco'" (Bagayev 1965: 348).

Also in N. K. Bagayev (Ibid.) we find the following observation: in the case of polysyllabic NIs and NIs with a strong vowel, the stress falls on the NI (`tsættæ kænyn` 'to prepare'; `mast kænyn` 'to grieve'). In the case of monosyllabic NIs with a weak vowel, the stress falls on the LV (`rokh kænyn` 'to forget').

Stress, therefore, is usually located on the nominal part if it is a full accent carrier; otherwise, the stress shifts to the LV. This indicates that the NI and LV form a single phonological word. Stress can also fall on the light verb when it carries logical stress. This fact, on the contrary, indicates the phonological autonomy of individual parts, which will be discussed somewhat below.

**Negation.** The negation marker is also usually located on the NI, cf.: "Another feature of compound verbs is that the negations `næ` and `ma` can stand before the nominal part, whereas in free combinations they must stand before the verb: `næ art kæny` 'he is not making fire'... `ma dis kæn` 'don't be surprised', but one does not say `næ kær-dzyn kæny`, `ma duar kæn`, one must say: `kær-dzyn næ kæny` 'she is not making bread', `ma duar kæn` 'don't open the door'" (Abayev 1970: 640).

Our Ossetian examples given above also place the negative particle `næ` before the NI:

(559) Ossetian
a. Ӕz nӕ lyg kodton dzul.
   I NEG cut LV.PST.1.SG bread
   'I did not cut the bread.'
b. Ӕz nӕ rynchyn dӕn.
   I NEG sick LV.PST.1.SG
   'I was not sick.'
c. Bækh nӕ gæpp kodta.
   horse NEG jump LV.PST.3.SG
   'The horse did not jump.'

When combining two independent lexical elements (and not a CP), negation is possible only on the verb – our data here again agree with V. I. Abayev’s observations:

(560) Ossetian
a. * Ciutæ nӕ akhston kodtoy.
   birds NEG nest do.PST.3.PL
   '*The birds NEG nested.'
b. Ciutæ akhston nӕ kodtoy.
   birds nest NEG do.PST.3.PL
   'The birds did not build a nest.'

At the same time, in contexts not associated with CPs, the negative particle `næ` with a nominal item is ungrammatical:

(561) Ossetian
a. * nӕ lyg dzul
   NEG cut bread
   '*uncut bread'
b. * nӕ rynchyn lӕppu
   NEG sick boy
   '*unsick child'
c. * nӕ gæpp
   NEG jump
   '*unjump'

As in the case of telicizing prefixes, it is possible to place the negative proclitic before the LV:

(562) Ossetian
a. Ӕz lyg nӕ kodton dzul.
   I cut NEG LV.PST.1.SG bread
   'I did not cut the bread.'
b. Ӕz rynchyn nӕ dӕn.
   I sick NEG LV.PRES.1.SG
   'I was not sick.'
c. Bækh gæpp nӕ kodta.
   horse jump NEG LV.PST.3.SG
   'The horse did not jump.'

**Linear Order.** The NI and LV in complex predicates cannot be separated, (564), or follow in a different order, (565):

(563) Ossetian
Ӕz uyy fe-rokh kodton.
I this PREF-forgotten LV.PST.1.SG
'I forgot this.'

(564) Ossetian
* Ӕz fe-rokh uyy kodton.
   I PREF-forgotten this LV.PST.1.SG
   '*I forgot this.'

(565) Ossetian
* Ӕz uyy kodton fe-rokh.
   I this LV.PST.1.SG PREF-forgotten
   '*I forgot this.'

In the case of lexical use of NI and LV, such transformations are permissible:

(566) Ossetian
a. Ciutæ znon kodtoy akhston.
   birds yesterday do.PST.3.PL nest
   'The birds built a nest yesterday.'
b. Ciutæ akhston znon kodtoy.
   birds nest yesterday do.PST.3.PL
   'The birds built a nest yesterday.'

At the same time, short enclitic pronouns – second-position clitics – can and must "embed" into the CP between the NI and LV: "If a sentence begins with a complex verb or a complex verb form, then the short form personal pronoun, with the exception of the associative case, is inserted between the constituent parts of the complex verb or complex verb form. For example: `Skhæts-tsæ yæ kodton znon` 'I mixed it yesterday', `Raarfæ yn kodtoy yæ khorz kuysty tykhkhæy` 'They thanked him for his good work', `Skhæts-tsæ dyn is abon (pis'mo)` 'The letter arrived for you today'..." (Bagayev 1965: 237-238).

Let us give our own example with the complex predicate `rokh kænyn` 'to forget':

(567) Ossetian
Fæ-rokh dæ kodton.
PREF-forgotten you LV.PST.1.SG
'I forgot you.'

Thus, the only lexical material that can violate the strict NI - LV order is second-position clitics, whose position in the clause is determined by phonological (not syntactic) rules.

**Impossibility of NI branching.** The NI within a CP cannot receive modifiers:

(568) Ossetian
a. Dy khid kæn-ys.
   you sweat LV.PRES.2.SG
   'You are sweating.'
b. * Dy khulydz khid kæn-ys.
   you wet sweat LV.PRES.2.SG
   'Expected: 'You are sweating wet sweat.''

(569) Ossetian
a. Zaur Fatima-yy ba kodta.
   Zaur Fatima-GEN⁴⁷ kiss LV.PST.3.SG
   'Zaur kissed Fatima.'
b. * Zaur Fatima-yy dywwæ ba-yy kodta.
   Zaur Fatima-GEN two kiss-GEN⁴⁸ LV.PST.3.SG
   'Expected: 'Zaur kissed Fatima twice.''

⁴⁷ Ossetian animate noun phrases in direct object position are encoded with the genitive case.
⁴⁸ Ossetian numerals assign the genitive case to nouns in subject and direct object position.

### 3.2.4. Structure of Ossetian CPs - First Approximation

As we have seen above, Ossetian CPs constitute a unified, strictly ordered whole in terms of the following parameters: i) prefixation, ii) stress, iii) negation placement, iv) order of elements, v) impermissibility of lexical dependents. Below, it will be shown that these properties are not accidental, but rather demonstrate the presence of an ordered structure of the verb phrase, containing the NI and LV and including, besides them, some amount of functional structure.

The properties of CPs in Ossetian listed above – namely, the linear ordering of elements relative to each other and to elements "external" to the construction – allow us to assert that the NI and LV occupy specific positions in the structure of the verbal projection.

The combination of NI and LV forms a complex lexeme of category V, adhering to the same rules that govern syntactic elements: in a specific order, changes to which lead to a change in interpretation or ungrammaticality of the construction. The NI is a head, but it participates in the formation of a lexical (not phrasal) level unit, which explains the impossibility of its modification (*`wet-sweat`*, *`twice-kiss`*).

We will consider that the nominal item occupies the head position of some projection F1P, over which the light verb, represented by the functional head F2, dominates. The ontological status and contribution of each of these heads to the structure and interpretation of the verb phrase will be discussed specifically somewhat below. After landing in the head position, the NI moves upwards along the structure and merges with the LV, forming a single word form with it. Movement "upwards" in the structure in this case corresponds to rightward movement, as the head of the entire complex predicate (LV) is located to the right; a brief remark on this will follow somewhat below. Note that another analysis would be possible, in which the CP would have rightward branching, and the observed surface word order NI - LV would be the result of leftward head movement of the NI. In both cases, further derivation would proceed identically. We will, nevertheless, adhere to the idea of leftward branching within the CP, if only because the reverse surface order is never observed and we have no evidence of rightward branching.

The impossibility of reversing the NI and LV order and inserting external material between them follows automatically from the proposed structure. The NI and LV occupy the head position of F2, and no other material can separate two functional heads (except other functional heads, which we do not find in this case). The NI - LV order is related to the order of head merger with each other (left adjunction, right adjunction) during head movement, see (Matushansky 2006a):

(570) <!-- image -->

Such a process of complex head formation resembles the approach to direct object incorporation as a result of head movement undertaken in (Baker 1988).

In the case where a CP is transitive, the direct object occupies the internal subject position – it is the logical subject of the state specified by the NI: `Alan zarazil Fatimu` 'Alan infected Fatima' – 'Alan made Fatima sick':

(571) <!-- image -->

In this case, the direct object X corresponds to the noun phrase `Fatima` in the example above, the adjectival NI to the adjective `bol'noy` 'sick', and the light verb to Ossetian `kænyn` 'to do'.

Let us note another regularity related to morphological marking. If a prefix is used together with negation, both elements can be located either on the NI (unmarked option) or on the LV simultaneously. Placing one of the elements on the NI and the other on the LV is excluded:

(572) Ossetian

|    |                               |                                   | Translation                                       |
|:---|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| a. | Ӕz duar nӕ bay-gom kodton.     | I door NEG PREF-open LV.PST.1.SG  | 'I did not open the door.'                       |
| b. | Ӕz duar gom nӕ bay-kodton.     | I door open NEG PREF-LV.PST.1.SG  | 'I did not open the door.'                       |
| c. | * Ӕz duar bay-gom nӕ kodton.   | * I door PREF-open NEG LV.PST.1.SG | '*I opened not the door.'                        |
| d. | * Ӕz duar nӕ gom bay-kodton.   | * I door NEG open PREF-LV.PST.1.SG | '*I did not open the door.'                      |

As stated in (Gagkayev 1952: 91): "The negation `næ` is used with verbs in the indicative and subjunctive moods and stands before the verb to which it refers." Prefixes form a single word form either with the NI or with the LV. Since both morphemes have a fixed position in the verb phrase, we will consider that each of them corresponds to its own functional head.

It is generally accepted that the negation phrase NegP is usually located above the aspectual projection AspP, see, for example, (Brown, Franks 1995) for Russian, (Cornilescu 2003) for English, and (Cinque 1999) as an example of constructing a universal hierarchy of functional projections. Such an arrangement of Neg, Asp, and the verb phrase helps to explain both the impossibility of (separate) placement of negation and aspectual prefix on different parts of the CP, and their ability to be located (in pairs) either on the NI or on the LV.

Both regularities follow directly from the so-called Head Movement Constraint (Travis 1984). According to this universally recognized constraint, head movement is only possible to the position of the head immediately dominating the given one. "Skipping" over head positions is impermissible.

Thus, CPs with negation and a prefix must have the following form:

(573) <!-- image -->

Neg and Asp are functional projections that take as a complement the material they dominate; NegP takes AspP as its complement, and AspP takes F2P. Iranian languages are noteworthy in that functional projections take their complements to the right, while lexical ones take them to the left, see, for example, (Karimi 2005). Ossetian behaves similarly: alongside the order subordinating conjunction - subordinate clause (C - TP), the branching order of lexical complements is reversed: direct object - verb, (predominantly) postposition - noun phrase, etc.

This explains the fact that Neg and Asp take complements to the right, while branching within the CP projection is leftward: the LV is a rightward head relative to the NI, and the NI also takes its arguments to the left (more on this will be said below). From the perspective of branching direction, both LV and NI behave as lexical heads and are thus contrasted with functional heads, which are expressed morphologically.

The position of the NI directly after the aspectual prefix is, therefore, the result of its initial position to the right of Asp and the subsequent movements of the NI to the F2 position and the NI + LV complex to the head position of Asp. After the head movement occurs, the direct object projected by it also moves to some FP position higher in the structure – a possible analog of such a position would be the AgrO head, responsible for assigning accusative case to the direct object in early versions of Minimalism, see (Chomsky 1993):

(574) <!-- image -->

The impossibility of placing negation before the NI and the prefix before the LV follows from the Head Movement Constraint. Once formed, the complex head NI + LV cannot be "broken apart" further; the X0-complex NI + LV can only move as a single unit:

(575) <!-- image -->

When the prefix and/or negation are located on the LV, the derivation proceeds differently. First, the LV moves unhindered into Asp – since F2 dominates F1, the Head Movement Constraint is not violated. After this, the entire projection of the nominal item F1P moves from the complement position of the light verb projection F2P:

(576) <!-- image -->

The movement of the NI projection occurs to the specifier position of the focus head – recall that, according to V. I. Abayev, negation and/or the prefix are located on the LV when "the nominal part carries logical stress: instead of `næ dæ ferokh kodton` 'I didn't forget you', one can say `rokh dæ næ fækodton` 'I didn't forget you', with logical stress on `rokh`" (Abayev 1970: 640).

Second-position clitics, such as `dæ` in V. I. Abayev's example just given, do not follow the rules of syntactic projection but rather phonological rules, and therefore are not a counterexample to the prohibition on placing lexical material between the NI and LV.

Thus, in cases where negation / the aspectual prefix are located on the LV, we are inclined to see the movement of a constituent (rather than a head) corresponding to the NI. The analysis with phrasal movement is confirmed by the rules of stress placement: "In cases where the noun is enclosed by a prefix and stands directly before the predicative member, all three components of the predicate unite into a single whole with common stress" (Gagkayev 1956: 57). The same is found in (Bagayev 1965: 348): "In many forms of the perfective aspect, there is only one stress, which usually falls on the nominal part when the verbal prefix is added to the nominal part preceding the auxiliary verb." And further: "...if the prefix is part of the auxiliary verb... stress will fall on both the nominal part and the auxiliary verb."

The same is true for stress with negation: "Complex verbs with negative words have two stresses, one of which falls on the nominal part of the verb, the other on the light verb with the negative word, when the negative word stands directly before the light verb... But if the negative word stands before the nominal part of the compound verb, then the entire compound verb with the negative word is pronounced with a single stress" (Ibid.: 348).

Thus, unlike cases of contiguous NI and LV placement, when a prefix and/or negative particle are located between them, the stress "breaks apart": it necessarily falls on the NI and, most likely, also on the LV. Such behavior automatically follows from our analysis. In the case of F1P movement, which occurs when the LV is marked by an aspectual or negative particle, the NI+LV structure, which would form a single phonological word in the absence of movement, breaks down into two constituents, each of which must receive its own stress.

Recall that the choice of the aspectual prefix, which characterizes the entire CP as a whole, is determined by the nominal part even when the prefix is located on the LV. This behavior of CPs regarding stress and prefixation confirms the correctness of the approach to CP structure as both a syntactic projection and a lexeme simultaneously. We can formulate the following:

(577) Observation on the internal organization of Ossetian complex predicates
CPs can exhibit properties of both a word and a constituent.

In cases where there is no material between the NI and LV, the NI, being in its base head position, phonologically forms a single word form with the LV. In cases where negation or a prefix is found on the LV, the NI and the constituent it heads move upwards in the structure, "destroying" the CP as a single lexical complex.

So, we have established the main projection nodes responsible for CP formation. Next, we will discuss the rules governing their argumental and eventive structure, i.e., primarily, the question of which heads are responsible for projecting the CP's arguments.

### 3.2.5. Means of Expression of NI and LV in Ossetian CPs

#### 3.2.5.1. Types of NI

We will begin our discussion of the argument structure of Ossetian CPs by specifying what lexical material can constitute the NI and LV. Then, we will analyze the structure of prefixless and then prefixed CPs, in particular, examining the distributional properties that, in different cases, distinguish natural classes of CPs with different NIs and LVs.

The nominal item of Ossetian CPs can be expressed by an adjective or a noun.

**Adjectives.** The most typical adjectival NIs are gradual adjectives. When used as NIs within CPs, they denote the (gradual) acquisition of the property they specify:

(578) Ossetian
a. tænæg kas
   liquid porridge
   'liquid porridge'
b. Sarv tænæg kodta.
   butter liquid do.PST.3.SG
   'The butter melted.'

(579) Ossetian
a. tsættæ khærinag
   ready food
   'ready food'
b. Khærinag s-tsættæ is.
   food PREF-ready be.PST.3.SG
   'The food got ready.'

As far as we know, any adjective denoting a gradual property can form a CP. Derivational morphology is not an obstacle either: for example, denominal adjectives with the suffix `-dzhyn` also form CPs:

(580) Ossetian (Ossetian-Russian Dictionary 1970)
a. niz - 'pain'
   nizdzhyn - 'sick'
b. ad - 'taste'
   addzhyn - 'tasty'
c. kad - 'honor'
   kaddzhyn - 'honorable'

(581) Ossetian
a. nizdzhyn kænyn - 'to infect'
b. addzhyn kænyn - 'to make pleasant', 'to sweeten'
c. kaddzhyn kænyn - 'to glorify'

In this regard, we note the importance of the categorical status of lexemes and the role of recategorization markers. The same lexemes can also form CPs in the absence of a derivational marker:

(582) Ossetian (Ossetian-Russian Dictionary 1970)
ba-niz kænyn - 'to cause pain'

The only structural difference between the CP `nizdzhyn kænyn` 'to fall ill' and the CP `niz kænyn` 'to cause pain' is the adjectivizer `-dzhyn`. With the presence of this marker, as we can see, transitivity also changes – a CP from an adjective can be transitive, whereas a denominal CP is always intransitive (more on this below). This regularity can be easily expressed in terms of our proposed approach. In a structure where there is an adjective, the internal argument (the direct object of a transitive CP) effectively occupies the position of its subject – it is the logical subject of the situation specified by the adjective, 'to be sick'. The ability to predicate a state to some participant is a categorical property of adjectives, which nouns are not capable of. Thus, the categorical marker Adj, phonologically represented here as `-dzhyn`, transitivizes the CP by adding a level of "internal" predication to its structure:

(583) <!-- image -->

The interpretation of the internal adjectival projection F1P here will be 'X is sick', which would be impossible if F1P were a nominal projection rather than an adjectival one. The presence of an adjectivizer (and more broadly – the Adj feature, whether expressed morphologically or not) thus "opens up" the specifier position – the subject of the internal projection.

**Nouns.** Nouns used as NIs are eventive nouns:

(584) Ossetian
a. Yæ ækhkhuys adæmæn uydi styr.
   his help people.DAT was great
   'His help to people was great.'
b. ba-khkhuys kænyn
   PREF-help do
   'to help'

(585) Ossetian
a. mæsty gæpp
   desperate jump
   'desperate jump'
b. Purti ne-gæpp-ytæ kodta.
   ball NEG-jump-PL do.PST.3.SG
   'The ball did not bounce.'

Examples (a) demonstrate the use of nouns as the head of a noun phrase, examples (b) – as an NI. Only abstract nouns denoting processes can be used as NIs, including those like 'fire' (`art kænyn` - 'to burn'), 'smoke' (`fæzdæg kænyn` - 'to smoke'). The use of mass nouns, such as 'salt', 'stone', etc., as NIs (hypothetical CPs 'to salt', 'to turn to stone') is impossible. Some nouns, such as `lævar` 'gift' (`lævar kænyn` - 'to give a gift') or `dikh` 'part' (`dikh kænyn` - 'to divide'), allow a resultative / object reading, but can also be used in the sense of a process ('giving', 'division' respectively), which is impossible with nouns like `salt`.

The obligatory presence of eventive semantics allows us to make an important clarification, in our opinion, regarding the structure of CPs with a noun as the NI. Namely, analyses of Iranian CPs performed in terms of (Ramchand 2008) usually assume that the functional heads `init` and `proc` are filled by an unpronounced copy of the light verb, and the NIs occupy the complement position to such heads, see, for example, (Pantcheva 2008):

(586) <!-- image -->

Besides the fact that such a structure is redundant (requiring unnecessary procedures for "erasing unwanted copies" of the LV), it is also problematic for another reason. The `proc` projection in such an analysis introduces an eventive component of the `proc` group; consequently, in its absence, the NI should be deprived of an eventive interpretation. On the contrary, if `proc` specifies the eventive part of `procP`, the NI can (and even should) be deprived of an eventive interpretation. What we actually observe is directly opposite: i) nouns entering into CPs can have an eventive interpretation outside the CP; ii) ordinary referential nouns are impossible as NIs.

We will assume that nouns forming the NI usually have a complex structure, including the `proc` head responsible for eventive interpretation. Such a head takes the N head of the lexical noun as its complement and is itself a complement of some nominal functional shell `n`:

(587) <!-- image -->

Within a CP, such a structure interacts with other projections responsible for different phases of the subevent. Outside the boundaries of a CP, such nouns can also be deprived of the `proc` shell, having a referential / resultative meaning (`podarok lezhal na stole` 'the gift lay on the table'; `ya by otdal ves' mir za odin yeyo potseluy` 'I would give the whole world for one kiss from her', ...). For brevity, we will hereafter represent the structure of nouns with an eventive component simply as [n].

The structure presented reflects the observation made above that all NI-nouns participating in CP formation are eventive. The `proc` head, therefore, is not obligatory for CP formation. We adopted a similar solution above for NI-adjectives – they do not need verbal heads to predicate a state to their internal subjects (= direct objects of the verb); for this, it is sufficient for them to have a certain categorical affiliation.

#### 3.2.5.2. Varieties of LVs

In further research, we will largely rely on the analysis of LVs proposed by M. Butt, see, for example, (Butt 2003; Butt, Lahiri 2013). LVs, from Butt's perspective, are contrasted with both auxiliaries and lexical verbs. LVs, according to Butt, should also not be confused with serializers, which typically grammaticalize into auxiliaries, which does not happen with LVs. LVs, according to Butt, have another diachronic and typological feature – they always coexist synchronously with their full-fledged lexical correlate.

As we have already mentioned, in Ossetian, LVs are represented by the verbs 'to be' and 'to do':

(588) Ossetian
a. Æz s-mæsty dæn.
   I PREF-angry be.PST.1.SG
   'I got angry.'
b. Æz s-mæsty kodton me fyd-y.
   I PREF-angry do.PST.1.SG my father-GEN
   'I angered my father.'

### 3.2.6. Argument Structure of Prefixless NIs

Below, we will successively examine the dependence of the argument structure of prefixless CPs on various combinations of the following features: i) lexical category of the NI; ii) type of copula ('to be' and 'to do'). We will define the possible combinations of such features and the argument structure of each (grammatical) combination.

#### 3.2.6.1. Arguments of CPs with Adjectives

NI-adjectives can combine with both LVs, varying the number of participants depending on the LV. Some Ossetian NIs have flexible categorical membership and can be used as both adjectives and nouns. In this part of the work, we will mainly discuss adjectives that do not have nominal homonyms.

**LV 'to be'.** As noted in (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013), the combination of an NI-adjective with the LV 'to be' is ungrammatical. Here are our own examples demonstrating this:

(589) Ossetian
* Aslan lӕguyn is.
   Aslan bald be.PRES.3.SG
   '*Aslan was balding.'

(590) Ossetian
* Dzidza lyg is.
   meat cut be.PRES.3.SG
   '*The meat is cut.'
`'The meat was being cut.'`

To express an inchoative meaning in this case, the intransitive variant of the verb `kænyn` is used.

Naturally, the verb 'to be' never forms transitive predications:

(591) Ossetian
* Aslan lyg is dzidza.
   Aslan cut be.PRES.3.SG meat
   '*Alan cut the meat.'

**LV 'to do'.** The prefixless LV `kænyn` in combination with an NI-adjective can form both intransitive and transitive predications:

(592) Ossetian
Aslan mæsty kodta.
Aslan angry do.PST.3.SG
'Aslan was angry.'

(593) Ossetian
Zaur Alan-y mæsty kodta.
Zaur Alan-GEN angry do.PST.3.SG
'Zaur angered Alan.'

Prefixless CPs with adjectives are non-telic. This follows from their compatibility with temporal adjuncts like 'two hours':

(594) Ossetian
Khærinag tsættæ kodta dywwæ sakhaty.
food ready do.PST.3.SG two hours
'The food was preparing for two hours.'

(595) Ossetian
Ӕz tsættæ kodton khærinag dywwæ sakhaty.
I ready do.PST.3.SG food two hours
'I cooked food for two hours.'

An analysis of the structure of adjectival prefixless CPs will be proposed below.

### 3.2.6.2. Structure of Prefixless CPs with Adjectives

Intransitive CPs with LV `kænyn` and an NI-adjective have the following underlying structure:

(596) <!-- image -->

The participant acquiring the quality predicated by the CP is initially generated as the internal subject of the adjective phrase. The verb `kænyn` in intransitive CPs introduces the meaning of transition to a new state ('to be angry') and corresponds to the phase of an unbounded process, which is syntactically expressed by the `proc` head, dominating the result phase `res` and the "predicative" adjective phrase. The adjective phrase predicates a state ('to be angry' etc.) irrespective of aspectual (and temporal) characteristics – these are introduced into the structure by means of LVs `kænyn` and `uyn`, which in this case convey that the property 'to be angry' is acquired by the adjective's "subject," the noun phrase `Aslan`.

The LV `kænyn` also allows for the formation of transitive CPs from adjectives without a prefix. In this case, the verb 'to do' corresponds not only to the `proc` head but also to the head that defines the causative subevent in the verbal structure, `init`:

(597) <!-- image -->

From the perspective of event structure, the verb `kænyn` in this case corresponds not only to the process phase but also to the initial phase of the entire event. From the perspective of argument structure, `kænyn` introduces an external causative participant, which is generated in the specifier of `initP`. The specifier of the outermost verbal projection, `initP`, corresponds to the specifier of small `v` in the usual, non-decompositional approach. The result, as in the case of an intransitive situation, is defined by the `res` projection, which takes the adjective phrase as its complement.

Let's say a few words about how, out of various realizations of the verbs `kænyn` and `uyn`, only one remains phonologically expressed. Modern generative theory is technically developed enough to offer various engineering solutions (e.g., allowing movement mechanisms, deleting one "extra" copy out of several, etc.). We will adopt the following solution: all three elementary heads constituting the verb phrase correspond to different Ossetian LVs. The initial causative phase `init` and the event unfolding stage `proc` are specified by the verb `kænyn` 'to do'. The verb `uyn` 'to be' corresponds to the resulting phase `resP`:

(598) <!-- image -->

The rules for head realization are as follows:

(599) Rules for head realization in Ossetian CPs:
i) The verb structure can contain one to three heads from this set, which determines the argumental and eventive structure of the CP;
ii) The highest of the heads is pronounced.

For example, prefixless NIs with an adjective are always non-telic – they lack the `res` head. The functions of the verb `kænyn` in prefixless adjectival CPs are: i) introduction of a process phase in intransitive CPs, and ii) introduction of a process phase together with a causative phase, which introduces an external argument, in the case of transitive CPs.

The ungrammaticality of prefixless adjectival CPs with the verb 'to be' is explained in (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013) as the result of this LV losing a competition for phonological realization. As the authors suggest, the verb 'to be', which has (only) an inchoative meaning, competes with 'to do', which introduces a greater amount of structure into the derivation – an inchoative component and the VP itself, also containing an internal argument. The verb 'to do' wins the competition based on the principle of greater specificity – it is necessary to choose the element that carries a greater amount of grammatical information.

Our approach will differ somewhat from the analysis proposed in (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013). We will consider that the internal argument – the direct object of transitive verbs and the sole participant of intransitive adjectival CPs – is always an argument of the adjective, and the verb `kænyn` takes no part in its projection.

The LV 'to be', `uyn`, corresponds only to the `resP` level of the internal verbal projection, which distinguishes it from `kænyn`, which corresponds to the two other internal levels of lexical structure, `proc` and `init`. Since non-telic prefixless CPs do not contain a resultative stage, the verb `uyn` 'to be' is absent from their structure. This idea will be developed in more detail below.

### 3.2.6.3. Arguments of CPs with Nouns

Here we will compare the structure of prefixless CPs with nouns and prefixless adjectival CPs, described above.

**LV 'to be'.** NI-nouns within prefixless CPs are ungrammatical with the LV 'to be':

(600) Ossetian
* Ӕz lenk dæn.
   I swimming be.PRES.1.SG
   '*I was swimming.'

(601) Ossetian
* Bækh gæpp is.
   horse jump be.PRES.3.SG
   '*The horse was jumping.'

Naturally, transitive predications with `uyn` 'to be' are also impossible.

**LV 'to do'.** Nouns acting as NIs can form CPs, which in this case can only be intransitive:

(602) Ossetian
Aslan lenk kodta.
Aslan swimming do.PRES.3.SG
'Aslan swam.'

(603) Ossetian
Bækh gæpp kodta.
horse jump do.PST.3.SG
'The horse jumped.'

Transitive CPs with an NI-noun are forbidden:

(604) Ossetian
* Ӕz bækh-y gæpp kodton.
   I horse-GEN jump do.PST.1.SG
   '*I made the horse jump.'

(605) Ossetian
* Zaur Aslan-y lenk kodta.
   Zaur Aslan-GEN swimming do.PRES.3.SG
   '*Zaur made Aslan swim.'

Intransitive denominal CPs are non-telic – they combine with duration adjuncts like 'two hours':

(606) Ossetian
Bækh gæpp kodta dywwæ sakhaty.
horse jump do.PST.3.SG two hours
'The horse jumped for two hours.'

Below we will present an analysis of the structure of denominal prefixless CPs.

### 3.2.6.4. Structure of Prefixless CPs with Nouns

CPs with nouns differ from CPs with adjectives in the following parameters: i) NI-nouns describe certain active actions (see above), while NI-adjectives correspond to inchoatives; ii) NI-nouns do not have their own arguments, while NI-adjectives project a noun phrase that is their logical subject and occupies the position of their specifier in the syntactic structure.

These differences correspond to differences in the structure of the verb phrase as a whole. As we indicated above, nouns used as NIs retain an eventive interpretation not only within CPs but also in other syntactic contexts. All that eventive nouns need within a CP are argument(s), since such nouns themselves do not project arguments, and argumentless predications are impossible – a predication must necessarily have a subject. This restriction was explained in Government and Binding Theory with the Extended Projection Principle (Chomsky 1981); in Minimalism, the obligatoriness of the subject was proposed to be due to the necessity of feature checking on the T head, which determines the finiteness of the clause (Chomsky 1995). Whatever the theory explaining the subject phenomenon, the very fact of the obligatory presence of at least one participant can be considered universal. A subject is necessary for the overwhelming majority of sentences in all languages for which research on the subject problem has been conducted – there are no exceptions to this rule, as far as we know.⁴⁹

⁴⁹ Leaving aside intralinguistic characteristics by which subjects are defined, constructions like Russian `Bylo kholodno` 'It was cold' and similar problems.

Thus, in order to construct a grammatical clause, at least one argument is necessary. When constructing CPs with nouns, the projected argument cannot have another source besides the light verb. Therefore, in CPs with nouns, the LV introduces a participant responsible for the initiation of the event, in other words – a causer. The causer is inserted at the `initP` phase level, projected by the LV `kænyn`:

(607) <!-- image -->

The designation EA (External Argument) corresponds to the described role of the causer. Alongside it, we will distinguish the role of the internal argument, IA (Internal Argument). The external argument possesses (not necessarily a complete, but sufficient) set of properties usually associated with agentivity: consciousness, animacy, ability to control the action performed, etc. The internal argument, on the contrary, possesses a set of properties characteristic of a patient: inanimacy, inability to control the process, susceptibility to external influence (affectedness), etc., see (Dowty 1991).

The internal argument in our system is linked only to adjectival NIs and realizes the logical subject of the adjective. The external argument can only be introduced by verbs that have a projection responsible for the agent / causer. Among the two auxiliary verbs in Ossetian, only 'to do' is such, but not 'to be'. The inability of the verb 'to be' to introduce an external participant and the lack of an inherent participant for NI-nouns explain the ungrammaticality of denominal CPs with 'to be'. The grammaticality of adjectival NIs with 'to be' is explained by the same reason.

The argumental properties of the elements forming denominal CPs also explain facts related to transitivity and its prohibition. Transitive CPs, i.e., verbs with an external and internal participant, are simultaneously possible in our system only if: i) there is a verb 'to do' that introduces an external participant, and ii) there is an NI-adjective that introduces an internal participant. Another consequence is that a CP with a noun can only have an external participant, while CPs with adjectives can have only an internal participant or be transitive.

### 3.2.6.5. Properties and Structure of Prefixless CPs: Brief Summary

Thus, by studying prefixless CPs, we have established the following: i) an adjective in the role of NI is responsible for the internal argument, which is its logical subject; ii) a CP with an NI-noun does not have its own internal participant; iii) an external participant (if present) is always projected by the verb 'to do'; iv) the verb `uyn` 'to be' has a resultative interpretation and does not participate in the formation of non-telic prefixless LVs; v) the verb `kænyn` 'to do' corresponds to a causative subevent and a process subevent.

We have also established the rules for CP head realization: i) each CP can contain one to three heads from the set `init`, `proc`, `res`; ii) the highest of these heads is pronounced.

### 3.2.7. Argument Structure of Prefixal NIs

In the case of prefixal CPs, restrictions related to the telicity introduced by the prefix are imposed on the underlying structure. The telicity of Ossetian verbs with prefixes is shown in (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013), and we will accept this as an established fact, requiring no additional proof. The restrictions examined below are related to both argumental and eventive structure.

### 3.2.7.1. Arguments of CPs with Adjectives

**LV 'to be'.** Unlike prefixless CPs, adjectival CPs with a prefix are grammatical with the light verb 'to be':

(608) Ossetian
Dzidza s-ævzær is.
meat PREF-bad be.PRES.3.SG
'The meat spoiled.'

As stated in (Abayev 1970: 640): "Preverbal forms of compound verbs, formed with the present tense of the auxiliary verb `uyn` 'to be', have a past tense meaning: `ferokh dæn` means 'I am forgotten', not 'I am forgetting'. Let us recall that past tense forms of intransitive simple (non-compound) verbs are also historically compound from a past participle and the present tense of the verb `uyn` 'to be'. Therefore, `a-khyld-is` 'he crawled away' (from the simple verb `khylyn` 'to crawl') and `a-khyl-is` 'he quarreled' (from the compound verb `akhyl uyn` 'to quarrel') are completely identical in structure."

Adjectival prefixal CPs denote a final state into which the internal participant, expressed by the subject, transitions. We will assume that deadjectival prefixal CPs contain only the phase of the final state `res` and do not contain the `init` and `proc` phases.

**LV 'to do'.** The difference between prefixal adjectival CPs and prefixless ones is that they can only be transitive; intransitive variants are ungrammatical:

(609) Ossetian
Zaur Alan-y s-mæsty kodta.
Zaur Alan-GEN PREF-angry do.PST.3.SG
'Zaur angered Alan.'

(610) Ossetian
* Aslan s-mæsty kodta.
   Aslan PREF-angry do.PST.3.SG
   '*Aslan got angry.'

An analysis of the structure of adjectival CPs with a prefix will be presented below.

### 3.2.7.2. Structure of Prefixal CPs with Adjectives

Two significant differences between prefixal adjectival CPs and prefixless ones are, therefore: i) the possibility of forming intransitive CPs with the verb 'to be', and ii) the impossibility of intransitive usage with the verb 'to do'.

The ungrammaticality of prefixless CPs with `uyn` 'to be' has been explained by us earlier: `uyn` corresponds only to the resultative part of the verbal structure and, therefore, cannot encode inchoative predications that have not reached a result, which is what prefixless non-telic CPs are. In the case of prefixal CPs, the `res` head, represented by LV `uyn`, interacts with the telic meaning of the prefix and successfully defines the final state:

(611) <!-- image -->

The reasons for the ungrammaticality of prefixal intransitive usage of LV `kænyn` 'to do' are as follows. As we saw above, the verb 'to do' can be used transitively (`Zaur Alany (s)mæsty kodta` 'Zaur angered Alan') or intransitively (`Alan mæsty kodta` 'Alan was angry'). In the intransitive case, `kænyn` corresponds to the `proc` projection. Cases of transitive prefixal usage differ from prefixless usage by the presence of the `res` head (see (612) on p. 314).

(612) <!-- image -->

`initP`, the highest head of the verb phrase, as described above.

We need to explain the ungrammaticality of the intransitive structure with a prefix:

(613) <!-- image -->

We propose that the impossibility of such a structure follows from a restriction on the ability of the verb `kænyn` to introduce arguments. We assume that the ability to introduce its own argument exists only for [`init kænyn`]⁵⁰, but not for [`proc kænyn`]. If this is so, it is easy to explain all transitive usages of CPs – they are always based on [`init kænyn`] 'to do'. It is more difficult with intransitive variants of CPs, namely – with the verb `kænyn` functioning as an LV in prefixless CPs (`Alan mæsty kodta` 'Alan was angry').

⁵⁰ Here and below, when speaking of the variant of the verb 'to do' [`init kænyn`], we will also imply – in accordance with our assumption about the phonological realization of the highest phase of the verb – those realizations of `kænyn` that also contain [`proc kænyn`]. The contrast, therefore, will be between [`init kænyn`] and [`init kænyn` [`proc kænyn`]], on the one hand, and [`proc kænyn`] – on the other.

We propose that in the intransitive variant of adjectival CPs, the verb [`proc kænyn`] is used, which lacks the ability to introduce an external argument. The function of [`proc kænyn`] consists only in introducing the process phase of a situation. With such an analysis, the grammaticality of both transitive usages and prefixless intransitive usage follows automatically. However, the ungrammaticality of prefixal intransitive usage needs to be explained (`*Alan smæsty kodta` 'Alan got angry').

For this, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that both usages of `kænyn` as a light verb correspond to different lexical usages. The analogue of the light verb [`init kænyn`] is a lexical verb with the meaning 'to make, produce, generate...':

(614) Ossetian
a. Ciutæ akhston kodtoy.
   birds nest do.PST.3.PL
   'The birds built a nest.'
b. Mad kodta syvællon-y khqældzæg.
   mother do.PST.3.SG child-GEN cheerful
   'The mother made the child cheerful.'

This version of 'to do', [`init kænyn`], can also be used with telicizing prefixes:

(615) Ossetian
a. Ciutæ akhston s-kodtoy.
   birds nest PREF-do.PST.3.PL
   'The birds built a nest.'
b. Mad s-kodta syvællon-y khqældzæg.
   mother PREF-do.PST.3.SG child-GEN cheerful
   'The mother made the child cheerful.'

The situations 'The birds built a nest' and 'The mother made the child cheerful' differ. In the first case, a previously non-existent object comes into being as a result of the described action; such usages of 'to do' correspond to 'creation-doing'. As it seems to us, the basis of obligatorily transitive CPs is precisely [`init kænyn`], 'creation-doing'. Such a verb 'to do' is associated with the presence of a causer, whose actions lead to the existence of a new object.

In cases like 'The mother cheered up the child', there is a change of state of an already existing object; such cases correspond to the meaning of 'secondary predicate-doing'. In transitive CPs with an NI-adjective, we are dealing with the verb `kænyn` – 'secondary predicate-doing', cf. its usual usage as a depictive secondary predicate: 'The mother made the child happy'. The analogue of 'secondary predicate-doing', [`proc kænyn`], is a lexical verb with the meaning 'to become, to turn into...':

(616) Ossetian
a. Syvællon kodta khqældzæg.
   child do.PST.3.SG cheerful
   'The child was becoming cheerful.'
b. Alan kodta akhuyrgænæg.
   Alan do.PST.3.SG teacher
   'Alan was becoming a teacher.'

A distinctive property of the intransitive variant of lexical `kænyn` 'to become' is its ungrammaticality when used with prefixes:

(617) Ossetian
a. * Syvællon s-kodta khqældzæg.
   child PREF-do.PST.3.SG cheerful
   '*The child became cheerful.'
b. * Alan s-kodta akhuyrgænæg.
   Alan PREF-do.PST.3.SG teacher
   '*Alan became a teacher.'

Thus, we can formulate the following observation: transitive lexical verbs 'to do' can combine with a prefix, while intransitive lexical verbs 'to do' cannot. The same applies to `kænyn`-LV. The LV [`init kænyn`] can introduce an external argument and appear in a prefixal form, while [`proc kænyn`] can do neither.

In our proposed analysis, the ungrammaticality of intransitive prefixal CPs follows from the fact that [`proc kænyn`] differs from [`init kænyn`]. The reasons why [`proc kænyn`] cannot be used with prefixes may be related, for example, to the fact that in the absence of the `res` head, the combination of `proc` and an adjectival base cannot satisfy the condition for situational completeness imposed by the prefix.

So, what we observe is a clear functional differentiation among intransitive verbs: [`proc kænyn`] is used in non-telic situations, while [`res uyn`] is used in telic ones. One possible reason for the ungrammaticality of prefixal [`proc kænyn`] might be its competition with [`res uyn`], cf. a similar observation in (Lyutikova, Tatevosov 2013).

### 3.2.7.3. Arguments of CPs with Nouns

**LV 'to be'.** Like prefixless CPs, denominal CPs with a prefix are ungrammatical with the light verb 'to be':

(618) Ossetian
* Bækh a-gæpp is.
   horse PREF-jump be.PRES.3.SG
   '*The horse jumped.'

(619) Ossetian
* Aslan a-lenk is.
   Aslan PREF-swimming be.PRES.3.SG
   '*Aslan swam/arrived by swimming.'

As in all previous cases, transitive predications with `uyn` 'to be' are also impossible, as stated in (Bagayev 1965: 284): "Compound verbs which include the auxiliary verb `uævyn` with prefixes (`sakhuyr uævyn` 'to learn', 'to get used to', `ærbakhæts-tsæ uævyn` 'to arrive', `smæsty uævyn` 'to get angry', `fækhqær uævyn` 'to become public', etc.), are only intransitive perfective aspect, for example: `sakhuyr dæn` '(I) learned', '(I) got used to', `sakhuyr uydzynæn` 'I will learn', 'I will get used to', `ærbakhæts-tsæ dæn` '(I) arrived', `ærbakhæts-tsæ uydzynæn` 'I will arrive', `smæsty dæn` '(I) got angry', `smæsty uydzynæn` 'I will get angry', etc."

**LV 'to do'.** The verb 'to do' allows denominal CPs to form telic intransitive clauses:

(620) Ossetian
Bækh a-gæpp kodta.
horse PREF-jump do.PST.3.SG
'The horse jumped.'

(621) Ossetian
Aslan a-lenk kodta.
Aslan PREF-swimming do.PST.3.SG
'Aslan swam/arrived by swimming.'

As with prefixless CPs, transitive denominal CPs are ungrammatical:

(622) Ossetian
* Aslan bækh-y a-gæpp kodta.
   Aslan horse-GEN PREF-jump do.PST.3.SG
   '*Aslan made the horse jump.'

(623) Ossetian
* Zaur Aslan-y a-lenk kodta.
   Zaur Aslan-GEN PREF-swimming do.PST.3.SG
   '*Zaur made Aslan swim/arrive by swimming.'

The only exceptions are the so-called direct objects of path, see (Ramchand 2008: 43-45):

(624) Ossetian
Kæsag don-y a-lenk kodta.
fish river-GEN PREF-swimming do.PST.3.SG
'The fish swam across the river.'

The properties of such objects generally differ from those of standard internal arguments (for example, they are permissible in intransitive predications, cf. Russian: `Zhizn' prozhit' - ne pole pereyti` 'To live a life is not to cross a field' [idiomatic: 'Living a life is not easy'], etc.).

Below we will present an analysis of the structure of denominal CPs with a prefix.

### 3.2.7.4. Structure of Prefixal CPs with Nouns

The internal organization of prefixal CPs with nouns is a simple result of the merger of prefixless CPs with nouns and the AspP group:

<!-- image -->

In the formation of all denominal CPs, the LV [`init kænyn`] is used, which is responsible for introducing the single (external) argument into the structure. Other arguments in CPs with an NI-noun are impossible, which is explained by the inability of nouns to project their own (internal) argument.

### 3.2.7.5. Properties and Structure of Prefixal CPs: Brief Summary

Prefixal CPs are possible in three variants: intransitive adjectival CPs with the verb 'to be', and transitive adjectival and intransitive nominal CPs with the verb 'to do'. The light verb 'to be' [`res uyn`] is used with intransitive CPs with adjectives because it occupies the position of the `res` projection and, combined with a telicizing prefix, expresses the meaning of a final state ('Aslan got angry', etc.). In the case of transitive adjectival and intransitive nominal CPs, the LV [`init kænyn`] participates in the structure, introducing an external participant of the situation. The LV [`proc kænyn`] is incompatible with prefixes. The ungrammaticality of transitive CPs with an NI-noun is exacerbated by the absence of inherent arguments for nouns.

### 3.2.8. Contexts,
### diagnosing the presence of external and internal arguments of CPs

The conditions for the presence of an external argument in a CP were essentially indicated by us above – it is the impossibility of the CP being used with the LV 'to be'. The verb `uyn` does not project any arguments, which contradicts the requirement that there must be at least one participant in a predication. Thus, if the NI does not provide its argument, the verb `uyn` cannot be used. The impossibility of using 'to be' distinguishes a separate class of denominal CPs – these are the so-called non-ergative verbs.

Below, we will demonstrate a test that, on the contrary, diagnoses the presence of an internal argument. Such a context for CPs is the possibility of using them in the form of a passive participle ((626)-(627)).

Passive participles from CPs are formed using the `kond` ('made') form of the verb `kænyn`. As we can see, the formation of passive

(626) Ossetian
ænkqærd kond læppu
sad LV.PART boy
'a sad/grieving boy'

(627) Ossetian
* lenk kond læppu
swimming LV.PART boy
'*a boy swimming'

the formation of participles is impossible from nominal CPs, but permissible from adjectival ones. This is explained by the fact that CPs with an NI-adjective possess an internal participant, without which passivization is impossible, or, in other words, CPs with an adjectival NI are unaccusative verbs.

Here is a summary table demonstrating the connection between argument structure and the two contexts we have studied (`uyn` and `kond`):

(628) Tests for the Presence of External and Internal Arguments
| | NI-Adj (unaccusatives) | NI-N (unergatives) |
|---|---|---|
| ungrammaticality with `uyn` (→ EA) | ok | * |
| grammaticality with `kond` (→ IA) | ok | * |

### 3.2.9. Structure of Adjectival and Nominal CPs: Summary

Thus, using CPs with adjectives and nouns as examples, we have defined the basic principles of forming Ossetian CPs. The distribution of CP arguments follows the rules presented in table (629).

(629) Argument Structure of Ossetian CPs
| NI | LV | prefixless | prefixal |
|----|----|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Adj | 'do' | EA: ✗; IA: ✓; EA+IA: ✓ | EA: ✓; IA: ✓; EA+IA: ✓ |
| Adj | 'be' | EA: ✗; IA: ✗; EA+IA: ✗ | EA: ✗; IA: ✓; EA+IA: ✗ |
| N | 'do' | EA: ✓; IA: ✗; EA+IA: ✗ | EA: ✓; IA: ✗; EA+IA: ✗ |
| N | 'be' | EA: ✗; IA: ✗; EA+IA: ✗ | EA: ✗; IA: ✗; EA+IA: ✗ |

EA (External Argument) corresponds to the subject of transitive and unergative intransitive verbs. IA (Internal Argument) corresponds to the direct object of transitive verbs and the subject of unaccusative intransitive verbs. The designation EA+IA corresponds to the expression of both participants in transitive CPs.

The facts presented in the table adhere to the rules we have formulated: i) the internal argument is always introduced by the adjective; ii) the external argument is always associated only with [`init kænyn`]; iii) the LV [`proc kænyn`] specifies only the process phase (but no other phases); iv) the LV [`res uyn`] specifies only the result phase (but no other phases); v) neither [`proc kænyn`] nor [`res uyn`] introduce arguments.

The rules for the phonological realization of the `init`, `proc`, and `res` heads are presented in the table below:

(630) Phonological Realization of LVs Depending on Transitivity and Presence of Prefix
| | prefixless | prefixal |
|---|---|---|
| Tr | `kænyn` | `a- / s- / ... + kænyn` |
| Itr | `kænyn` | `a- / s- / ... + uyn` |

When discussing the morphosyntax of CPs, we mentioned the fact that the choice of the prefix's phonological form determines the NI. The phonological realization of the LV, in turn, is determined by the functional heads that form the lexical structure of the CP. We believe that the head that turns out to be the highest among those available in a given structure is realized. In transitive CPs, this is always [`init kænyn`]. In intransitive CPs, it can be [`res uyn`] – if the process and causation phases are absent, or [`proc kænyn`] – if only the process phase is represented in the structure.

***

Thus, each element participating in a CP makes a specific contribution to the argument and event structure of different types of CPs. Next, we will consider some facts related to the distribution and interpretation of CPs, demonstrating that adjectives within CPs can project their own constituents and combine with morphological markers. These facts, it seems to us, indicate a deep connection between the adjective and the state it defines, and the structure of the verb phrase into which the adjective is incorporated.

### 3.2.10. Morphological Markers on NI

In this part of the work, we will briefly discuss examples of morphological marking of NIs within compound predicates.

#### 3.2.10.1. Adjectival Morphology on NI

Adjectives containing a gradable feature and filling the NI position within CPs denote the acquisition of a certain state, which in the case of Ossetian CPs can be expressed by both the positive and comparative degrees of the adjective: "A qualitative adjective as the nominal part of a compound verb can be in its base form (i.e., in the positive degree) and in the comparative degree, for example: `khorz kænyn` 'to become good', 'to do well', 'to get better', `khuyzdær kænyn` 'to improve' (intransitive), 'to improve' (transitive), `sabyr kænyn` 'to make, to become quiet', `sabyrdær kænyn` 'to make, to become quieter', etc." (Bagayev 1965: 270).

In works devoted to the semantics and typology of adjectives, the following observation is described, see (Bobaljik 2012) and the sources cited therein: if an adjective forms its comparative degree suppletively, the verb derived from it will be formed precisely from the suppletive comparative stem. Another well-known observation on the relationship between the positive and comparative degrees, dating back to E. Sapir (Sapir 1949), is that the comparative is semantically simpler than the positive degree. Indeed, for many adjectives, the meaning of the positive degree, for example, 'wide', contains not only a description of a certain parameter ('width') but also information that this parameter exceeds the standard norm for this type of object (a wide river – 'a river whose width exceeds the norm'). At the same time, the comparative form 'wider' is devoid of the presupposition that the object is actually wide.

One might expect that Ossetian CPs, having the option to be formed from comparative stems, would prefer this derivation option. However, as far as we know, CPs are formed from both forms of adjectives, comparative and positive, without special restrictions. Often, no visible differences in meaning are found:

(631) Ossetian
a. Ӕz fe-styr kodton dzykk.
   I PREF-big do.PST.1.SG pit
   'I deepened the pit.'
b. Ӕz fe-styr dær kodton dzykk.
   I PREF-big CMP do.PST.1.SG pit
   'I deepened the pit.'

Possible differences are found only with adjectives with a so-called closed scale – in this case, the meaning of the CP derived from comparatives is accompanied by the translation 'even more':

(632) Ossetian
a. Ӕz duar ærbay-gom kodton.
   I door PREF-open do.PST.1.SG
   'I partially opened the door.'
b. Ӕz duar ærbay-gom dær kodton.
   I door PREF-open CMP do.PST.1.SG
   'I opened the door even more.'

(633) Ossetian
a. Duar ærbay-gom is.
   door PREF-open be.PST.3.SG
   'The door partially opened.'
b. Duar ærbay-gom dær is.
   door PREF-open CMP be.PST.3.SG
   'The door opened even more.'

Such an "addition" to the interpretation is related to the fact that the positive degree of the adjective already denotes reaching the state 'the door is open'.

The comparative marker `dær`, which is part of the CP, is also capable of assigning its arguments, namely, the object of comparison, which is encoded analogously to objects of ordinary comparative constructions, i.e., with the ablative:

(634) Ossetian
Zaur Alan-æy ænkqard dær u.
Zaur Alan-ABL sad CMP be.PRES.3.SG
'Zaur is sadder than Alan.'

(635) Ossetian
Zaur Alan-æy æ-ænkqard dær is.
Zaur Alan-ABL PREF-sad CMP be.PST.3.SG
'Zaur became sadder than Alan.'

One can assume that in the structure of the CP, the comparative corresponds to its own functional head responsible for the projection of the object of comparison:

(636) <!-- image -->

As shown in diagram (636), the comparative head can be incorporated into the functional projections that constitute the verbal lexeme and exert a predictable influence on both the semantics and the set of possible participants of the CP.

#### 3.2.10.2. Nominal Morphology on NI

As typological studies show, the plural marker that marks nominal stems of CPs introduces the meaning of iterativity of the action into the verb, see (Shluinsky 2005). Ossetian follows the same scenario⁵¹:

(637) Ossetian
a. Zaur khuyft kodta.
   Zaur cough do.PST.3.SG
   'Zaur coughed.'
b. Zaur khuyft-tæ kodta.
   Zaur cough-PL do.PST.3.SG
   'Zaur coughed (many times).'

The addition of a plural marker to the noun here conveys the meaning of repeated occurrence of the situation.

Plurality can also be used with adjectives. It is important that plurality indeed indicates iterativity, not plurality of objects. In the following example, the plural grammeme conveys that the same book was forgotten more than once:

(638) Ossetian
Fatima chinyg rokh-tæ kodta.
Fatima book forgotten-PL do.PST.3.SG
'Fatima often forgot the book.'

Plurality of objects occurs only in the case of verbs of creation / destruction. This is a natural consequence of the peculiarities

⁵¹ The problem of interpreting number markers was discussed by me during field research with S. G. Tatevosov; some of the observations presented below belong to him.

of the semantics of such verbs – the same object cannot be created / destroyed multiple times:

(639) Ossetian
a. * Fatima chiri s-tsættæ-tæ kodta.
   Fatima pie PREF-ready-PL do.PST.3.SG
   '*Fatima prepared the pie many times.'
b. Fatima chiri-tæ s-tsættæ-tæ kodta.
   Fatima pie-PL PREF-ready-PL do.PST.3.SG
   'Fatima prepared pies many times.'

The plural marker actually indicates the multiplicity of resultant states (in cases like 'prepare', 'forget') or acts of process repetition ('cough', etc.). However, the plural grammeme turns out to be quite strongly integrated into the lexical meaning of the verb. This is manifested, in particular, in the inability of verbs whose internal participant and NI are marked with plural number to have a distributive interpretation:

(640) Ossetian
Fatima chinguy-tæ rokh-tæ kodta.
Fatima book-PL forgotten-PL do.PST.3.SG
Meanings:
i) 'Fatima often forgot books.'
ii) * 'Fatima once forgot many books.'

If interpretation (ii) were permissible, it would describe a situation in which for each of the forgotten books, there is a resulting state 'the book is forgotten', and there are many such situations. The impossibility of a distributive interpretation most likely indicates that at the moment when the internal participant and the adjective combine into one projection, the object noun phrase already receives the number marker and a plural reading, but the NI does not yet:

(641) <!-- image -->

If, at the moment when the NI interacts with the internal object, the plural number on the NI were already present, it would be possible to interpret it as a multiplicity of objects. The plural marker is most likely located higher in the structure of the NI. This is generally consistent with the fact that the NI has the status of a head, not a phrase – otherwise, the internal object would be the subject not of the lexical head, but of some constituent. The functional projection responsible for the number of the NI is located higher; the NI passes "through it" when raising to the dominating `res` head:

(642) <!-- image -->

Ultimately, we find that in the process of derivation, the NI first interacts with its specifier (the internal object), and only then with the number marker and the part of the structure responsible for the projection of verbal categories.

### 3.2.11. Summary of Ossetian Compound Predicates Analysis: Internal Subject of AdjP and Dominant resP

We have shown that compound predicates can exhibit properties of both words and constituents. The compositional nature of compound predicates allows us to trace the internal properties of the individual parts from which they are formed, and the process and variants of composition themselves. The argument and event structure of compound predicates is predictably determined by the interaction of the nominal part, the light verb, and the prefix.

The analysis of Ossetian compound predicates confirms that unaccusative and unergative predicates differ significantly in terms of argument and event structure. The argument structure of unaccusatives is formed with the participation of adjectival elements. The subjects of such adjectives are noun phrases that acquire the state conveyed by the adjective. Such compound predicates are inchoative if they are used with light verbs that are unable to introduce an external argument and correspond to processes or results. Unaccusative predicates acquire a causer and become transitive if their formation involves a light verb capable of introducing a causative subevent.

The same version of the light verb is used with unergative and transitive verbs. Unergative predicates are formed with the participation of stems of eventive nouns that do not have their own internal participant, while unaccusatives are formed from adjectives that can have their own subject. Thus, the properties of compound predicates depend significantly on the lexical category of the element that forms them. Since compound predicates themselves are units of the lexicon, we find facts that refute the acategoriality of roots involved in word formation. We will touch upon this issue in more detail later, in Chapter 4.

When morphological markers are added to the nominal part, changes in the lexical semantics of the predicate are also transparent. NIs within Ossetian CPs can receive comparative degree and number markers. Individual markers, which usually mark adjectives or nouns, are freely incorporated into CPs, predictably changing the lexical semantics of the newly formed verb. Adjectival / nominal markers on the NI modify the representation of the resulting state (or process), i.e., they contribute to the verbal meaning in accordance with the meanings of the original grammemes.

Compound predicates constitute a significant stratum of verbal vocabulary in Iranian and many other languages. We can conclude that our hypothesis about adjectives as an internal projection of stative predicates is confirmed by the data from such languages. The adjective, which specifies the final state, is incorporated here into the lexical structure of the verb. We believe that this occurs as a result of the `resP` projection being built over it. Previously, we argued for the existence of such a projection, built over the adjective, based on the analysis of short forms of Russian adjectives (and participles), as well as adjectival vocabulary in languages with statives. Now we have another argument, provided by languages with compound predicates. Thus, the predicative-stative nature of adjectives receives various morphosyntactic manifestations in languages of different structure and origin.

## Chapter 4. Attributivity: between Lexicon and Syntax

This chapter will present facts from the domain of attributivization – a process by which an element acquires the ability to be used as a modifier within a noun phrase. We will primarily consider cases where a constituent is attributivized – these are interesting both from the perspective of internal organization and from the perspective of relations between the lexicon and syntax.

In this book, we advocate the idea that a universal attributive head A exists in language. Such a head is always present in the structure of adjectives and participles. The process of diachronic identification of a certain part of the lexicon with such a head (and disidentification with categorical heads V and N) leads to the formation of a separate category of adjectives. The status of head A is dual – on the one hand, it is universal, and on the other hand, it may not have a corresponding (and only corresponding) lexical class. Such is, for example, the situation in languages with statives. In a number of languages (see section 1.2.1), an element of any category and type (head, phrase) can be attributivized. The functional head A, thus, truly "works" "between the lexicon and syntax." In this chapter, we will demonstrate this dual status in cases where combinations of stems or word forms undergo attributivization.

Largely due to this intermediate position of adjectives "between the lexicon and syntax," the process of forming combinations of two or more stems into a complex adjective is extraordinarily productive in the languages of the world. We will consider two classes of cases: the formation of new lexical units and "pure" attributivization. The first scenario leads to the emergence of new dictionary elements, of category Adj or Atr. This occurs in the case of Russian compound adjectives. In the second scenario, the formation of modifiers (attributivization) occurs in the syntax and is not connected to the lexicon. Such is the situation in a number of Uralic, Altaic, and Nakh-Dagestanian languages.

### 4.1. Phrasal Attributives in Languages without Agreement in the Noun Phrase

#### 4.1.1. Attributivization in Altaic Languages - First Approximation

In Russian, subordination in compound adjectives is formed using the same suffixes that create new adjectives from a single stem ((dvukh-)yakornyy 'two-anchored', (legko-)atleticheskiy 'track-and-field'). This situation is quite common – in a number of languages, there are morphological markers specialized in the role of adjectivizer or attributivizer.

Let's say a few words about the concept of attributivization, which is important to us. By attributivization, we will mean the process of acquiring the ability for adjectival distribution. Such a process can have three realization scenarios: i) a new adjective is formed (Adj feature); ii) a new attributive is formed (Atr feature); iii) a unit of a phrasal category, XP, gains the ability to become a modifier. We will also refer to the latter case as attributivization.

Attributivizers in many languages can modify not just a single stem, but an entire constituent, cf. the example from Komi:

(643) Komi
(internet)
Me radeytl i [lö z sinm]-a nyløs.
I loved blue eye-ATR girl
'I loved the blue-eyed girl.'

Another ability of attributivizers is the possibility of attachment "on top of" morphological markers, such as number markers:

(644) Komi
lö z sin'yas-a pilot
blue eye.PL-ATR pilot
'a blue-eyed pilot'

Attributivizers in Russian are unable to attach to stems marked with a number marker. Despite the existence of some derivatives from suppletive plural stems like `detskiy` ('child's/children's') or `lyudskoy` ('human/people's'), semantically they are not contrasted by the feature of plurality with formations from singular stems like `rebyacheskiy` ('childish') or `chelovecheskiy` ('human'). As we will show in section 4.2, Russian attributivizers (and adjectivizers) are also unable to modify a phrase.

Next, we will discuss the properties of attributive projections that are similar to Russian compound adjectives but differ from them in internal organization. The data for discussion will come from some Turkic and Mongolic languages (see also section 2.1.2.4), as well as Nakh-Dagestanian languages.

#### 4.1.2. Comitative and Caritive as Adjectival Markers

Turkic and Mongolic languages have adjectivization means that form adjectives with comitative ('having something') and caritive ('lacking something') semantics. Adjectives formed in this way: i) can be gradable; ii) have non-derived correlates in other languages of the world:

(645) Tatar
köc-le - 'strong', köc-sez - 'powerless'
strength-ATR strength-CAR

(646) Azerbaijani
(internet)
şər əf-li - 'honorable', şər əf-siz - 'inglorious'
honor-ATR honor-CAR

(647) Buryat
(Serebryannikova 2015)
amta-tay - 'tasty', azal-güi - 'unemployed'
taste-ATR work-CAR
(Ye. V. Delikanova, p.c.)

Adjectives with such a meaning are often non-derived, cf., for example, Russian `slabyy` ('weak'), English `strong` and `weak`. Russian `silnyy` ('strong'), `pochetnyy` ('honorable'), `pozornyy` ('disgraceful'), `vkusnyy` ('tasty'), etc., despite stemming from nouns, form synthetic degrees of comparison (`sil'ney` 'stronger', `pochetney` 'more honorable', `pozorney` 'more disgraceful'), and are also, for example, used predicatively, i.e., they are adjectives just like, for instance, the non-derived `bystryy` ('fast'), `novyy` ('new'), etc.

Turkic derivatives with comitative and caritive markers can also take the marker `-rak / -rek`, used as an attenuative:

(648) Tatar
(internet)
köc-le-rek
strength-ATR-COMPAR
'a bit stronger'

(649) Tatar
(Zakiyev 1993: 67)
küñel-sez-rek
strength-CAR-COMPAR
'a little more powerless'

It is also possible to use intensifiers like 'very' etc. with these derived lexemes:

(650) Mishar
bik täm-le kitajk ɤ
very tasty-ATR Chinese.woman
'very tasty Chinese women'

Thus, the comitative marker `-ly / -li` (`-le`) and the caritive marker `-syz / -siz` (`-sez`) form lexemes with gradable semantics, i.e., they function as adjectivizers. However, these are not all their functions.

Before discussing other usages, let's provide examples of analogous formations in Buryat and Chuvash languages. Buryat comitative is marked by the suffix `-tay`, and caritive by the suffix `-güi`; Chuvash markers look like `lă` and `săr` respectively:

(651) Buryat
(Serebryannikova 2015)
a. amta-tay - 'tasty'
b. azal-güi - 'unemployed'

(652) Chuvash
a. tăn-lă - 'smart'
b. tăn-săr - 'stupid'

#### 4.1.3. Comitative and Caritive as Cases

The Buryat markers mentioned above can also mark the dependence of some participants on the verb:

(653) Buryat
(Serebryannikova 2015)
Badma basaga-ta-yaa yer-ee.
Badma girl-COM-REFL come-PRT1
'Badma came with his daughter.'

(654) Buryat
(Aksenova 2014)
Khor khüüyn-güi duula-na.
choir boy-NEG sing-PRES
'The choir sings without boys.'

Chuvash comitative and caritive, for example, can also have verbal usage:

(655) Chuvash
(internet)
Hal văl man-pa / * man-lă tuslă.
now he I-COM / * I-ADJ friendly
'He is friends with me now.'

(656) Chuvash
(internet)
Shkul-ta pĕr uyav ta man-săr irt-mes-t.
school-LOC one holiday and I-CAR go-NEG-PRES
'Not a single holiday in school passes without me.'

We see that in Chuvash, the same caritive marker is used for forming adjectives and for encoding a participant dependent on the verb. At the same time, the adjectivizer and the verbal comitative markers are different: `-lă` and `-pa` respectively. The situation is analogous in Kazakh, where there is one marker for the caritive and two different ones for the comitative. Diachronically, most likely, the Turkic (adjectival / nominal) marker `-ly / -le` also

was used with verbal adjuncts, evidence of which we find in some languages:

(657) Tubalar
Kara köz-tu körgiy le koshtoy bazyp
black eye-ADJ beloved COM nearby walking
tür-ed-im.
go-SER-1.SG
'I will go, walking side by side with my black-eyed beloved one.'

Currently, however, in most Turkic languages, the verbal comitative differs from the adjectivizer.

The use of (the same) comitative and/or caritive markers for introducing participants of verb-defined situations led some grammarians to recognize the existence of two additional cases – the comitative and the caritive, see (Levitskaya 1976: 22-25).

The following facts indicate that in the last examples given, we are dealing precisely with case markers. Such markers can attach to pronouns, see the Chuvash example above, cf. also Buryat:

(658) Buryat
a. nam-tay
   I-COM
   'with me'
b. nam-güi
   I-CAR
   'without me'

It is important that in Buryat, an oblique stem of pronouns is used, which is distinct from the nominative stem and serves for forming case forms.

If a separate marker developed for the verbal comitative, then the comitative adjectivizer can no longer mark pronouns. Such is the situation in Chuvash (see above) or Kazakh:

(659) Kazakh
a. * men-li
   I-ATR
   Expected: 'with me'
b. men-siz
   I-CAR
   'without me'

(660) Kazakh
Men-siz / * men-li senderge qiyiyn bolady.
I-CAR / * I-ATR you.PL.DAT difficult will.be
'Without me / * with me, it will be difficult for you.'

The ability to mark personal pronouns indicates that case markers mark DP-level units. Naturally, such markers can attach on top of number markers, i.e., to the NumP projection level, which "nests" within DP. Kazakh examples again show that for the caritive, which is permissible in case function, combination with number forms is grammatical, see also the following Kazakh example. At the same time, the combination of number markers with the adjectival `-ly` is ungrammatical:

(661) Kazakh
a. * taw-lar-ly
a′. taw-lar-syz
   mountain-PL-ATR mountain-PL-CAR
   Expected: 'with mountains' 'without mountains'
b. * küsh-ter-ti
b′. küsh-ter-siz
   strength-PL-ATR strength-PL-CAR
   'with strengths' 'without strength'

Case markers, naturally, can attach to noun heads modified by extended modifiers. We will demonstrate this with the Buryat comitative and Kazakh caritive:

(662) Buryat
(Serebryannikova 2015)
Zhargalmaa gansa Badm-yn
басага-тай
Zhargalmaa gansa Badm-yn basaga-tay nükherle-ne.
Zhargalmaa only Badma-GEN girl-COM be.friends-PRES
'Zhargalmaa is friends only with Badma's daughter.'

(663) Kazakh (internet)
Bizdiŋ keremet taw-lar-syz ne isteytin bolar edik?
our wonderful mountain-PL-CAR what do will be.PST.1.PL
'What will we do without our wonderful mountains?'

Below, we will consider cases where markers, which are clearly not case markers, possess the property of attaching a constituent.

### 4.1.4. Comitative and Caritive as Attributivity Markers

In the examples below, the comitative and caritive markers (glossed hereafter as ATR) mark an attributive constituent within a noun phrase:

(664) Mishar
a. [zeŋger küz]-le kyz
   blue eye-ATR girl
   'a blue-eyed girl'
b. [zur yört]-sez awyl
   big house-ATR village
   'a village without big houses' (~ 'a big-house-less village')

The dependents in the examples above are noun phrases with adjectives, but quantitative modifiers are also possible, for instance:

(665) Buryat (Aksenova 2014)
a. [taban nabshaһa]-tay seseg
   five leaf-COM flower
   'a flower with five petals'
b. [taban nabshaһa]-güi seseg
   five leaf-NEG flower
   'a flower without five petals'

(666) Kazakh (internet)
a. [eki zhaq]-ty sheshim-ge keldi
   two side-ATR decision-DAT came
   'they came to a bilateral decision'
b. [eki doŋģalaq]-syz mashina
   two wheel-ATR car
   'a car without two wheels'

Such attributive dependents clearly represent non-lexical units. They are formed by regular rules in the process of syntactic derivation. They also have a status greater than X⁰, but at the same time are not DPs. The fact that attributives are projections smaller than DPs can be demonstrated with examples involving the comitative in `-ly / -le`. As we established, the marker `-ly / -le` does not have a case usage, and therefore there is no danger of mistaking a case usage for an attributive one.

Firstly, we saw that the attributivizer `-ly / -le` cannot mark pronouns or attach to number markers; for convenience, we repeat the Kazakh examples:

(667) Kazakh
a. * men-li
   I-ATR
   Expected: 'with me'
b. * taw-lar-ly
   mountain-PL-ATR
   Expected: 'with mountains'

Secondly, the markers `-ly / -le`, when substantivized, can, on the contrary, receive number and case marking, which is impossible for case markers in Kazakh:

(668) Kazakh (internet)
Eki ayaq-ty-lar-da es zhoq.
two leg-ATR-PL-LOC memory no
'Two-legged beings have no memory at all.'

(669) Kazakh
a. * taw-nyŋ-da
   mountain-GEN-LOC
b. * taw-nyŋ-lar-da
   mountain-GEN-PL-LOC

Projections marked by the attributive are phrasal and have an intermediate status between NP and DP, see (Grashchenkov 2005; Lyutikova, Pereltsvaig 2014a; 2014b).

The fact that such structures have the status of constituents is also evident from the ability of attributivizers to form group inflection, similar to cases:

(670) Kazakh (internet)
a. Dala-lyq jəne taw-ly peyzazh-dar
   steppe-ATR and mountain-ATR landscape-PL
   'steppe and mountain landscapes'
b. Dala jəne taw-ly flora-ƣa
   steppe and mountain-ATR flora-DAT
   'steppe and mountain flora'

(671) Kazakh (internet)
b. Qyzaŋaq jəne qiiyar-dyŋ jaŋa sort-tar-y / tür-i
   tomato and cucumber-GEN new sort-PL-3.POSS / type-3.POSS
   'new varieties/types of tomatoes and cucumbers'

In examples (a) above, variants of coordinating two case groups are given, while in examples (b), the attributive and case markers are shared by two constituents.

### 4.1.5. Attributivization in Turkic and Mongolic Languages: Summary

We have established that Turkic and Mongolic languages possess comitative and caritive markers that regularly form new adjectives ('strong', 'powerless', etc.). The formally identical caritive marker, and in a number of languages, the comitative marker, can also form case constituents.

In addition, there is a third type of marker, also superficially coinciding with adjectival comitative and caritive. Markers of this type mark nominal dependency and attach constituents of some intermediate level – less than DP, but more than NP. Constituents of this type demonstrate certain syntactic properties, which primarily include freedom of formation and non-idiomaticity of derivatives.

We have shown that such formations can be analyzed within the hypothesis of an attributive functional head A. It takes nominal projections and marks them as attributes of the head noun: [DP [XP … [N]]-A N].

Altaic languages lack attributive agreement. Attributive word forms in them are limited to the A marker and do not contain a head responsible for agreement (an analogue of Russian adjP). Next, we will turn to the material of Dagestanian languages, where attributive agreement occurs.

### 4.2. Phrasal Attributives in Languages with Agreement in the Noun Phrase

### 4.2.1. Attributives in Avaro-Ando-Tsezic Languages

Some adjectival formations in Avaro-Ando-Tsezic languages, exemplified below by Bagvalal and Dargwa, possess an internal structure that is non-trivial from the perspective of Indo-European language speakers.

Typically, adjectives in these languages have a suffixal marker that reiterates the class (roughly coinciding with gender in European languages) and number of the head. A number of adjectives, however, have two agreement markers, a prefixal and a suffixal one:

(672) Bagvalal
r꞊eč'at'u꞊rmi ča
N.PL꞊black꞊N.PL hair
'black hair'

Formations like 'black-haired', 'long-legged', etc., can be constructed in one of two ways. On the one hand, they can be expressed by an ordinary genitive phrase, cf. (673) and (674):

(673) Bagvalal
Huli-ł beXun
down-GEN bed
'down feather bed'

(674) Bagvalal
a. r꞊eč'at'u꞊rmi ča-ł jaš
   N.PL꞊black꞊N.PL hair-GEN girl
   'a black-haired girl' (= 'a girl of black hair')
b. r꞊eč'at'u꞊rhoha-łi-ł waša
   N.PL꞊black꞊N.PL hair-OBL-GEN boy
   'a black-haired boy' (= 'a boy of black hair')

In the examples above, both markers agree with their head ('hair'), and the entire dependent constituent is in the genitive.

In another strategy for marking these meanings, the entire complex has the distribution of an adjective, with agreement of the prefixal marker with the "internal participant." In the Bagvalal and Dargwa examples below, adjectives, as is usual in the noun phrase of these languages, precede the head. However, immediately before these adjectives are "parametric" nouns, from whose perspective the head is characterized. The "internal" class-number marker of the adjectives agrees with these prepositive nouns. The "external," suffixal marker, meanwhile, agrees, as usual, with the head of the entire noun phrase:

(675) Bagvalal
a. miča r꞊eč'at'u꞊j jaš
   hair N.PL꞊black꞊F girl
   'a black-haired girl'
b. raba r꞊eXāla꞊w waša
   legs N.PL꞊long꞊M boy
   'a long-legged boy'

(676) Dargwa
naˁqː-bi d-išt'a-si darħa
hand-PL(ABS) N.PL-small-ATR boy
'a boy with small hands'

The agreement of the adjective with the prepositive noun indicates that in such constructions there is a stage of derivation where the complex of the parametric noun and the adjective forms a constituent:

(677) Bagvalal
[miča r꞊eč'at'u]꞊j jaš
hair N.PL꞊black꞊F girl
'a black-haired girl'

(678) Dargwa
[naˁqː-bi d-išt'a]-si darħa
hand-PL(ABS) N.PL-small-ATR boy
'a boy with small hands'

In (Kibrik 2001: 481), for Bagvalal, it is suggested that adjectives in this case replicate the behavior of participles in relative participial clauses:

(679) (Kibrik 2001: 481)
[o꞊j j꞊ełō]꞊b miq'-a-X…
this꞊F F꞊go.IPF-PART꞊N road-OBL-AD
'On the road where she was walking' (Context: 'robbers were encountered').

Within the discussion of agreement in simple sentences in (Kibrik 2001), it is hypothesized that the structure of participial relative clauses (~ 'she walking road') coincides with the structure containing complex adjectives (~ 'hair black girl'). One could try to reconstruct the supposed derivation.

One could propose an analysis in the spirit of L. Babby's approach to Russian adjectives, see (Babby 1975; Babby 1985). L. Babby suggests that Russian adjectives derive from relative clauses whose head is their short form: `Mal'chik, kotoryy bolen anginoy` 'The boy who is sick with angina' → `Mal'chik, bol'noy anginoy` 'The boy, sick with angina' (Ganenkov 2015) (Babby 1985: 158). If one assumes that in the relative clause `Na doroge_i, gde ona t_i shla` 'On the road_i, where she t_i was walking', there is a null element or a trace that allows retaining information about the semantic role of the participant, an analogous derivation can be seen in adjectival formations of the type `volosy chernye` 'hair black':

(680) Bagvalal
[t_i-Poss miča r꞊eč'at'u꞊j] jaš_i
hair N.PL꞊black꞊F girl
'a black-haired girl' ('a girl such that her hair is black')

One can assume that such constituents are formed from relative clauses with an adjectival head through possessor relativization.

In (Ganenkov 2015), a different analysis is proposed. According to D. S. Ganenkov, the constituent within which agreement occurs is a so-called small clause, see (Williams 1975; Rothstein 1995). The internal structure of a small clause can be represented as a symmetric constituent [X Y], where X is the subject and Y is the predicate. Small clauses are often associated with adjectives or participles, see (Hoekstra 2004; den Dikken 2006) and references therein.

However, a third variant of analysis, which we will adopt, can be proposed. We believe that adjectives with a prefixal class marker in Dagestanian languages differ from other adjectives. The prefixal marker corresponds to an additional agreement head, which, in turn, is followed by an adjectival projection A (cf. the structure of Russian full forms). We will present our analysis in several stages, using Bagvalal material as an example.

Let's start with the derivation of the structure of an "ordinary adjective" lacking a prefixal marker:

(681) Bagvalal
[hac'a꞊r miča]
white꞊N.PL hair
'white hair'

This occurs as follows:

<!-- image -->

This is not yet the final stage of noun phrase formation for `hac'ar miča`. To arrange the elements correctly, steps related to noun phrase derivation are missing, which we will omit. In the presented diagram, the "internal subject" of the adjective is generated – as in all previous cases with adjectives – in Spec, AdjP. After receiving its semantic role, it moves (via Spec, AP) upwards into the specifier of the agreement projection, where it spreads its class and number features to the functional agreement head of the adjective, adjCL.

Next, the adjective head moves sequentially into A and then into adjCL – the agreement analogue of the Russian adjP projection for the full form:

<!-- image -->

The adjectival head is "assembled" through successive left adjunction, resulting in the complex [adjCL miča-꞊r].

Let's consider the formation of the structure `miča r꞊eč'at'u꞊j jaš` 'hair N.PL꞊black꞊F girl'. In this case, the adjective consists of an "inner shell," analogous to the one just discussed, and an outer structure, also including Adj'P, A'P, and adjCL'P projections, the latter of which is responsible for the additional class marker. In the Adj position, as before, the "internal subject" is located. The "external" noun phrase, 'girl', is inserted – according to our assumptions – into the Spec, Adj'P position:

<!-- image -->

The first step is analogous to the beginning of the previous structure's derivation: the "internal subject" moves to adjCLP, and the "external" one to the adjCL'P position. Each noun phrase checks agreement with the closest class marker, see (685).

After this, the "lower" adjective group moves up into the head of the "external" adjCL', see (686).

Then the head 'girl' leaves the adjectival projection and moves into the external context of the noun phrase.

<!-- image -->

The analyzed case of Dagestanian agreeing attributives provides further evidence for the existence of a specifier position in Adj. This is supported by the possibility of internal agreement of the noun head `miča` with the prefixal class marker of the adjective `r꞊eč'at'u꞊`.

Let's turn to another nominal construction in Bagvalal. In (Kibrik 2001), the following variant of expressing color meanings is presented: "In the formation of color adjectives, the construction 'noun phrase in genitive + L'er 'color' + adjective marker -a꞊b' is very common, for example, `eqa꞊m aswalt-ił L'er-a꞊b` 'the color of wet asphalt', `beq-ił-L'er-a꞊b` 'apricot color' (beq 'apricot')" (Kibrik 2001: 194). Consider the following example:

(687) Bagvalal
[habe:ł [L'er]-a]꞊r hinc'-ibi
ash-GEN colored-ADJ꞊NPL stone-PL
'ash-colored stones'

The relations between the dependent nouns 'ash' and 'color' are marked here by the genitive, meaning we again have a phrase (XP). "Externally," the construction behaves like an adjective, agreeing with the matrix noun in class and number.

The main difference from the previous case is the presence of an adjectivization marker in this structure. The adjectivizer `-a` attaches to the nominal constituent `habe:ł L'er`, which has already formed a genitive group. In the specifier of AdjP, in accordance with our hypothesis, is the "internal subject," the future head of the noun phrase:

<!-- image -->

Above AdjP, AP and the agreement projection adjCLP are built in the standard way (cf. analysis of Russian and other adjectives). After this, the noun phrase closest to the adjCL head, see (Rizzi 1990), moves into its specifier to mark the features of number and class:

<!-- image -->

Then the complex [Adj [NP ash-GEN color] [Adj -a]], which has head status due to the adjectivizer Adj, moves into the position of the adjCL head:

<!-- image -->

### 4.2.2. Attributivization in Avaro-Ando-Tsezic Languages: Summary

As in the case of the Uralic and Altaic languages discussed above, Dagestanian languages possess means of converting phrasal-level constituents into attributive dependents. Dagestanian material demonstrates facts of non-trivial agreement in such constructions. We have shown how such facts can be analyzed within our proposed system. Attributivization of constituents occurs due to the participation of the functional head A or, in some cases, is a result of adjectivization (head Adj). We also showed that some facts of Dagestanian attributive agreement provide evidence for our hypothesis about the subject in the Adj projection.

### 4.3. Adjectival and Attributive Derivation in Russian

Within this work, we consider that the categorization of adjectives into a separate class actually occurs when lexical units appear that, in their unmarked form, combine with an attributive head A. The grammaticalization of an independent class of such units is accompanied by the emergence of recategorizing morphemes in the language, enabling units of other classes to combine with A (i.e., to function as modifiers). As we have seen in previous chapters, Russian has two classes of adjectives, adjectival and attributive. Correspondingly, there are two types of productive markers, see section 1.2.2. Below, we will describe the regular rules for forming new lexical units capable of being used attributively.

Complex derivatives also tend to have adjectival or attributive properties, cf. `dlinnonog` 'long-legged', `vtorosortney` 'second-rate-er' etc. vs. *`doistori-chesk` (*'prehistoric-Adj'), *`vysokosoderzhashchee` (*'high-content-Part'), etc. Such properties depend on the suffix that marks complex adjectives. However, we will not focus here on the opposition between adjectives and attributives as two lexical (sub)classes. The main question here, as throughout Chapter 4, will be the ability of the (Russian) language to form new adjectives from syntactic constituents.

We will try to show that despite the fact that Russian does not allow attributivization of constituents (XP), it possesses productive, semantically unrestricted models for forming adjectives from more than one stem. The freedom of forming new adjectives (limited, however, by a number of rules, see below) can be demonstrated by the following examples. Coordinated stems are one source of new adjectives, as we will see below. It is noteworthy, however, that in a number of cases, sufficiently elaborate conjunctive means, non-lexical but syntactic in nature, are used "inside" complex adjectives:

(691) (internet)
a. Nad raznomastnymi dvukh-, trekh- i dazhe pyatietazhnymi kirpichnymi domami vozvyshalisʹ ostrye shpili dvukh ma-gicheskikh bashen…
   'Above the motley two-, three-, and even five-story brick houses rose the sharp spires of two magical towers…'
b. Dvukh, a inogda i trekhurovnevye gipsokartonnye potolki s ovalami ili krugami…
   'Two-, and sometimes three-level plasterboard ceilings with ovals or circles…'

Next, we will discuss in detail the main syntactic models underlying compound words in Russian. Some syntactic constraints operating within compound words will be presented and analyzed. First of all, we will touch upon constraints on the direction and depth of derivation, as well as on coordination rules in compound adjectives.

### 4.3.1. Types of Syntactic Projections Underlying Russian Compound Words

Here we will present the most regular syntactic models on the basis of which compound adjectives are formed.

Formation of compound adjectives from a noun phrase. Compound adjectives are more than regularly formed from a combination of a noun and a dependent adjective:

(692) `vysokogornyy` ('high-mountain'), `ravnobedrennyy` ('isosceles'), `legkoatleticheskiy` ('track-and-field'), `yuzhno-afrikanskiy` ('South African'), …

The model with quantitative numerals is as productive as the adjective + noun model:

(693) `odnoglazyy` ('one-eyed'), `odnorazovyy` ('single-use'), `dvukhyarusnyy` ('two-tiered'), `dvugosudarstvennyy` ('bi-state'), `trekhetazhnyy` ('three-story'), `chetyrekhkolesnyy` ('four-wheeled'), …

Ordinal numerals can also be singled out into a separate group:

(694) `pervoklassnyy` ('first-class'), `vtorosortnyy` ('second-rate'), `tretʹestepennyy` ('third-rate'), …

The situation with quantificational words is somewhat more complex. The quantifier `vesʹ / vse` ('all'), which most actively participates in the derivation of complex adjectives:

(695) `vserossiyskiy` ('all-Russian'), `vsepogodnyy` ('all-weather'), `vsestoronniy` ('all-round'), `vsemernoy` ('all-encompassing'), …

Along with this, formations with the quantifier `kazhdyy` ('every') (more often, however, the component `yezhe-` is used) and the word `odin` ('one') in the meaning of 'the same' are also encountered:

(696) `kazhdodnevnyy` ('everyday'), `kazhdogodniy` ('annual'), `odnovremennyy` ('simultaneous'), `odnoimennyy` ('namesake')

Verb phrase. In the case of a verb phrase, the combined stems can also form different types of syntactic projections. Four productive types are observed here: incorporation of direct and indirect objects, as well as incorporation of adverbs and locative adjuncts. In (AG-80-1: § 755), it is indicated that compound adjectives are formed from verbs using suffixes: `-n`, `-telʹn`, `-lʹn`; `-liv / -chiv`, `-(o)m / -im`, `-l`, `-k`, `-en`, `-t`, as well as participial suffixes.

Let's first give examples of compound adjectives formed from a transitive verbal stem with a nominal stem – a direct object with the participation of adjective and participle suffixes:

(697) a. `bumagodelatelʹnyy` ('paper-making'), `gazoraspredelitelʹnyy` ('gas-distributing'), `dorozhno-stroitelʹnyy` ('road-building'), `kormozagotovitelʹnyy` ('fodder-procuring'), `tenevynoslivyy` ('shade-tolerant'), …
b. `zvukovosproizvodyashchiy` ('sound-reproducing'), `zvukoizoliruyushchiy` ('sound-insulating'), `metalloorabatyvayushchiy` ('metal-processing'), `nefteperekachivayushchiy` ('oil-pumping'), …

Verbal stems with an incorporated indirect object regularly form compound adjectives using adjective and participle suffixes:

(698) a. `elektroosvetitelʹnyy` ('electric-lighting'), `puleneprobivayemyy` ('bulletproof'), `energopitayemyy` ('energy-powered'), `elektroupravlyayemyy` ('electrically-controlled'), …
b. `elektrodvizhushchiy` ('electric-driving'), `gazosnabzhayushchiy` ('gas-supplying'), `knigotorguyushchiy` ('book-trading'), `domovladeyushchiy` ('house-owning'), `palʹtsegrozyashchiy`⁵² ('finger-threatening'), `golovokruzhacyy`⁵³ ('dizzying'), …
c. `elektrodvizhimyy` ('electric-driven'), `molepozhirayemyy` ('moth-eaten'), `gazosnabzhennyy` ('gas-supplied'), `snegozavalennyy` ('snow-covered'), …

Regarding a verbal stem with adverbial circumstances (of manner), this case can be illustrated as follows:

(699) a. `dolgoterpelivyy` ('long-suffering'), `maloizuchennyy` ('little-studied'), `trudnovospituyemyy` ('hard-to-raise'), `trudnoizlechimyy` ('incurable'), `bystrorastvorimyy` ('instant'), …
b. `zdravomyslyashchiy` ('sane'), `legkovosplamenyayushchiysya` ('flammable'), `perekrestno-opylyayushchiysya` ('cross-pollinating'), `prazdnoshatayushchiysya` ('loafing'), …

The incorporation of a locative adjunct can be demonstrated by the following examples:

(700) a. `sudokhodnyy` ('navigable'), `morekhodnyy` ('seaworthy'), `vodoplav(atelʹ)nyy` ('aquatic'), `tsentro-beznyy` ('centrifugal'), …

⁵² Well, rather not 'slippery', but, so to speak, 'finger-threatening' (internet).

⁵³ electric boiling kettle; dizzying, cool-bringing, electrically-powered (internet).

b. `vodoplavayushchiy` ('water-swimming'), `vozdukhoplavayushchiy` ('air-faring'), `zemlekhodyashchiy`⁵⁴ ('ground-walking'), `stenokhodyashchiy`⁵⁵ ('wall-walking'), …

We note one property that will be important for us later. The verbal stems listed above in syntax attach a prepositional phrase, cf.: `khoditʹ po moryu` 'to walk on the sea', `plavatʹ po vode` 'to swim in the water', etc. Despite this, in the resulting word form, the preposition is omitted. Possible reasons for such reduction probably lie in the restriction on the number of branches, see below.

Prepositional phrase. The prepositional phrase is another type of nominal projection that regularly forms compound adjectives. Prepositions included in the complex stem can have both spatial and temporal semantics:
- (701) `primorskiy` ('coastal'), `nastennyy` ('wall-mounted'), `pridorozhnyy` ('roadside'), `mezhdunarodnyy` ('international'), `posleobedennyy` ('post-lunch'), …

The contrast between the formation of a compound word from a prepositional phrase, on the one hand, and from a verb and its adjunct, on the other, is interesting. In the case where a sequence "preposition + noun" becomes an adjective, the preposition is retained. However, if an attempt is made to turn a group "preposition + noun + participle / adjective" into an adjective, the preposition is omitted.

### Coordination

The formation of coordinated adjectives into complex compounds is more than productive:

(702) `derevyanno-kirpichnyy` ('wooden-brick'), `vozvdushno-kapel'nyy` ('airborne-droplet'), `kislorodno-vodorodnyy` ('oxygen-hydrogen'), `angliysko-russkiy` ('English-Russian'), `kamenisto-musornyy` ('stony-rubble'), `soleno-sladkiy` ('salty-sweet'), `zubno-gubnoy` ('dentolabial'), …

Coordinated adjectives can appear in two variants. The first stem can be reduced, or it can be marked by a suffix, see also (AG-80-1: § 754):

⁵⁴ Since I am a `zemlekhodyashchiy` (ground-walking) person and it was my first time flying on a plane… (internet).

⁵⁵ I feel you'll have a new kind of parrot, a `stenokhodyashchiy` (wall-walking) one (internet).

Let's summarize our preliminary findings: the formation of compound words is a productive process that occurs according to the same principles as the formation of syntactic constituents. This process, however, is limited by a number of conditions related to the differences between the rules operating within a word and those operating outside of it.

The following table summarizes the syntactic models on which compound adjectives are built:

### 4.3.2. (Morpho)syntax of Russian Compound Adjectives
#### 4.3.2.1. Order of Derivation of Compound Words

Compound adjectives contain stems and derivational markers. An interesting question is the order of compound word formation. There are a total of four possible derivation scenarios. The first two cases, (a, b), represent an endocentric construction. In (a), the last stem first combines with the suffix, and then with the first stem. In (b), the stems first form a common constituent, and then attach the suffix. Variants with a symmetric internal structure, (c, d), are also permissible. Variant (c) assumes the combination of already formed adjective stems containing suffixes. In case (d), a suffix is added above a symmetric structure formed by two stems:

(705)
a. [ `kisl` [ `molok` [`-ʹn`] ] ]
b. [ [ [`kisl`] `molok` ] `-ʹn` ]
c. [ [`kisl`] [`molokʹn`] ]
d. [ [ `ki sl-molok` ] `-ʹn` ]

In coordination, structure (c) is found, see, for example, (Grashchenkov 2016). Below, we will show that in subordination, we are dealing with structure (b).

In (AG-80-1: § 760), compound adjectives are generally considered suffixal-compound in cases: i) when they are formed using a suffix different from that of the original second stem; ii) if simple analogues of parts of the compound words are absent; iii) if compound adjectives change their stress position. We will add two more arguments to these: iv) a change in the semantics of the second stem, and v) the semantic order of derivation.

As for defining the method of formation as suffixal-compound, we will understand this term as describing two consecutive stages: the formation of a complex stem and its subsequent suffixation.

### Suffix Change.
As an example of suffix change in compound adjectives, i), the following cases are provided in (AG-80-1: § 760):

(706) (AG-80-1: § 760)
a. `khodovoy` ('running') - `bystrokhodnyy` ('fast-moving'), `beregovoy` ('coastal') - `levoberezhnyy` ('left-bank'), `gruzovoy` ('cargo') - `tyazhelogruznyy` ('heavy-cargo'), `domovyy` ('house') - `odnodomnyy` ('single-house'), `golosovoy` ('voice') - `mnogogolosnyy` ('many-voiced'), `tsvetovoy` ('color') - `mnogotsvetnyy` ('multi-colored'), …
b. `godovoy` ('annual') - `ezhegodnyy` ('annual') and `proshlogodniy` ('last year's'), `novogodniy` ('New Year's'); `gorodskoy` ('city') - `inorodnyy` ('out-of-town'), …
c. `dvorovyy` ('yard') - `gostinodvorskiy` ('guest-court'), `rechnoy` ('river') - `moskvoretskiy` ('Moscow-river'); `stepnoy` ('steppe') - `golodnostepskiy` ('Hungry Steppe') (`Golodnaya step'` 'Hungry Steppe'), `zemel'nyy` ('land') - `novozemel'skiy` ('Novaya Zemlya') (`Novaya Zemlya` 'New Land')
d. `dushevnyy` ('soulful') - `krivodushnyy` ('crooked-souled'), `chinovnyy` ('official') - `raznochinnyy` ('commoner'), `slovesnyy` ('verbal') - `mnogoslovnyy` ('verbose')

To these examples, we can also add prepositional pairs:

(707) `detskiy` ('child's') - `bezdetnyy` ('childless'); `shefskiy` ('chief's') - `podshefnyy` ('under-patronage'); `pilotskiy` ('pilot's') - `bespilotnyy` ('unmanned')

Although some models are unproductive in the modern language, others undoubtedly appear quite "alive." The latter include transitions of `-ov` to `-n` and `-n` to `-sk`. In both cases, from units with a neutral semantics 'related to', we obtain semantically specified units. In one case (transition from `-ov` to `-n`), these are adjectives with the suffix `-n`, capable of gradual feature change (cf. also `zemlyanoy` 'earthy' - `redkozemel'nyy` 'rare-earth', `kostyanoy` 'bone' - `shirokokostnyy` 'broad-boned'). In the other (transition from `-n` to `-sk`), these are adjectives with the suffix `-sk`, belonging to the semantic class PLACE.

A change in the semantics of the second component might suggest that a new suffix is chosen due to a semantic mismatch. However, firstly, all suffixes used above are largely desemanticized. Secondly, the absence of adjectives like *`khodnyy`, *`domnyy`, *`golosnyy`, *`retskiy`, *`stepskiy`, … indicates that the required new suffix variant is connected to both stems, and not just to the second stem.

Another productive model can be added to the examples from (AG-80-1), related to derivatives from body parts. Single-stem adjectives in this case are formed using the suffix `-ast`, which has the semantics 'possessing X, exceeding the standard in some parameter'. In the formation of compound adjectives, this suffix does not participate, and the second stem turns out to be (phonologically) unmarked, while sometimes an alternation of full-vowel / non-full-vowel stems is observed:

(708) `ushastyy` ('big-eared') - `visloukhiy` ('lop-eared'); `golovastyy` ('big-headed') - `yaytsegolovyy` ('egg-headed') / `dvuglavyy` ('two-headed'); `glazastyy` ('big-eyed') - `kareglazyy` ('brown-eyed'); `zubastyy` ('big-toothed') - `belozubyy` ('white-toothed'); `shchekastyy` ('chubby-cheeked') - `krasnoshchekiy` ('red-cheeked'); `khvostatyy` ('long-tailed') - `dlinnokhvostyy` ('long-tailed'); `krylatyy` ('winged') - `krasnokrylyy` ('red-winged'), …

The change of the suffix `-ast` to a zero derivational marker also indicates that the order of derivation here differs from the order of adjective formation related to the second stem.

### Absence of Original Lexeme.
Close to the described scenario is situation ii), where the second stem does not form an independent adjective:

(709)
a. `odnonogiy` ('one-legged'), `semimil'nyy` ('seven-mile'), `trekhosnyy` ('three-axle'), …
b. `serosoderzhashchiy` ('sulfur-containing'), `samonadeyannyy` ('overconfident'), `trudnoulovimyy` ('hard-to-catch'), …

Examples (a) are cases where the second part consists of a noun that, for one reason or another, does not form an independent adjective: *`nogiy`, *`mil'nyy`, *`osnyy`⁵⁶. Examples in (b) include those where the second part is a participle, some of which exist in Russian (`soderzhashchiy` 'containing', `ulovimyy` 'detectable', …), but are used only with their own dependents, forming part of a verb phrase, i.e., they can only be participles, not adjectives:

⁵⁶ The adjective `osnyy` has the meaning 'having an axis', while `osevoy` means 'related to an axis', cf. `osevaya simmetriya` 'axial symmetry', `osevaya liniya` 'axial line', `osevaya nagruzka` 'axial load', etc.

(710) (internet)
a. `soderzhashchaya vrednyye veshchestva produktsiya` ('products containing harmful substances') vs. *`soderzhashchaya produktsiya` ('*containing products')
b. `s edva ulovimym zaiskivaniyem` ('with barely noticeable fawning') vs. *`s ulovimym zaiskivaniyem` ('*with noticeable fawning')

### Stress.
Next, let's move to argument iii), related to stress. Most compound adjectives have stress on the same syllable as their second parts:

(711) `glubokovódnyy` ('deep-water'), `odnorázovyy` ('single-use'), `vtorosórtnyy` ('second-rate'), `metalloobrabátyvayushchiy` ('metal-processing'), `energopitáyemyy` ('energy-powered'), `vozdukhoplávayushchiy` ('air-faring'), `primórskiy` ('coastal'), …

Note that the stress in such words is placed as if the complexes [stem 1 - stem 2 ] were formed first, and then the suffix was attached. Here are the arguments of A. A. Zaliznyak:

"...the stem of the word `bezloshadnyy` ('horseless') is obtained in two steps (cf. above): 1) `bez-` and `loshad-` combine into a prefixal-root complex `bezloshad-`; from an accentological point of view, this is a strong dominant stem with stress on the last syllable… but there is no corresponding real word; 2) the stem `bezloshad-` combines with the suffix `-n-`" (Zaliznyak 2002: 421).

Stress in compound words often does not coincide with the stress on the independently used head, see (ONS 2011). Russian compound words also place stress differently from the derivative of the second stem: `dvernóy` ('door') - `pyatidvérnyy` ('five-door'), `osnovnóy` ('main') - `dvukhosnóvnyy` ('two-stemmed'), see also the following examples from (AG-80-1):

(712) (AG-80-1, § 760)
`zemnóy` ('earthly') - `inozémnýy` ('foreign'), `stennóy` ('wall') - `tonkosténnyy` ('thin-walled'), `imennóy` ('personal') - `odnoimyónnyy` ('namesake'), `bol'nóy` ('sick') - `serdoból'nyy` ('kind-hearted'), `lesnóy` ('forest') - `melkolésnyy` ('small-forest'), `volnovóy` ('wave') - `korotkovolnóvyy` ('shortwave'), `vekovóy` ('century-old') - `srednevekóvyy` ('medieval'), `morskóy` ('sea') - `severomórskiy` ('North Sea'), `dnevnóy` ('daily') - `yezhednévnyy` ('everyday'), …

Note that in all these cases, the adjective derived from the second stem has a strong inflection `-óy`. When a compound word is formed, the stress shifts exactly one syllable forward - from the inflection to the stem (`zemnóy` - `inozémnýy`) or to the suffix (`volnovóy` - `korotkovolnóvyy`). In the first case, the principle "form a complex compound and place stress on it as if it were a phrase" works again. However, in the case of stress on the suffix, it no longer yields the desired result.

Here, the approach adopted, for instance, in Distributed Morphology – a syntactic theory created for the analysis of morphological phenomena, see (Halle, Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997) – will help us. One of the key concepts in Distributed Morphology is the so-called Late Insertion, see, for example, (Harley, Noyer 1999). According to the principle of Late Insertion, abstract lexical and morphological units are first assembled into a constituent, and then, once the syntactic tree of these units is complete, it is pronounced by the phonological module.

Evidently, the principle of Late Insertion works in the examples above at the level of [[stem 1 - stem 2 ]-suffix]. In cases where the suffix is a potential bearer of stress, it is placed on the suffix. When the suffix cannot bear stress, it falls on the stem.

Late Insertion also helps resolve another problem. A. A. Zaliznyak introduces the concept of so-called "loose connection" for cases where the attached morpheme (in our case, i.e., in the case of [stem 1 - stem 2 ], the first stem) "does not change the accentuation of the main part of the word form," see (Zaliznyak 2002: 376), and further there: "For example, `dvukhvintovoy` ('two-screw') from a semantic point of view is a relational adjective to 'two screws' (like `dvuruchnyy` 'two-handled' to 'two handles'), i.e., 'semantic brackets' are placed differently here than morphophonological ones. Cf. also the absence of semantic differences between the variants `pervoocherëdnyy` and `pervoocherednoy`." In other words, the problem in cases like `dvukhvintovoy` is as follows: stress placement occurs according to the same rules as when only the second stems are formed (`vin-tovóy` - `dvukhvintovóy`, etc.), i.e., formally it seems as if the complex [stem 2 -suffix] is formed first, and then stem 1 is added to it, leading to the final [stem 1 [stem 2 -suffix]]. At the same time, the order of semantic derivation is [[stem 1 - stem 2 ]-suffix].

In this case, the principle of Late Insertion also explains the difference in the placement of phonetic and semantic boundaries (the so-called bracketing paradox). First, the "full assembly" of the complex [[stem 1 - stem 2 ]-suffix] occurs, and then its pronunciation, which in this case coincides with the rules for pronouncing the complex [stem 2 -suffix].

### Semantic Change.
Argument iv) is that many adjective stems that serve as the head of compound words significantly change their meaning. Let's provide the following examples:

(713) `stodisyatisil'nyy` ('one-hundred-and-ten-horsepower'), `trekhsotletniy` ('three-hundred-year-old'), `raznostoronniy` ('versatile'), `ravnomernyy` ('uniform'), …

The lexemes `sil'nyy` ('strong'), `letniy` ('summer'), `storonniy` ('outside'), `mernyy` ('measured') have a different semantics than their analogous parts in the compound adjectives listed above. This can be shown by changes in their syntagmatics:

(714) `stodisyatisil'nyy dvigatel'` ('one-hundred-and-ten-horsepower engine') ≠ #`sil'nyy dvigatel'` ('strong engine')
`trekhsotletniy konflikt` ('three-hundred-year-old conflict') ≠ `letniy konflikt` ('summer conflict')
`raznostoronniy chelovek` ('versatile person') ≠ `storonniy chelovek` ('outsider')
`ravnomernoye dvizheniye` ('uniform movement') ≠ #`mernoye dvizheniye` ('measured movement')

### Semantic Order of Derivation.
Another argument from the field of semantics is related to the possibility of tracking the influence of some suffixes on the structure they mark. Thus, a number of Russian adjective suffixes have transparent semantics. For example, the suffixes `-ist` and `-(ch)at` have approximately the following interpretation: 'containing X in large quantity (on the surface)':

(715)
a. `voloknistyy` ('fibrous'), `shchetinistyy` ('bristly'), `glinistyy` ('clayey'), `bugristyy` ('hilly'), `tenistyy` ('shady'), …
b. `vesnushchatyy` ('freckled'), `brevenchatyy` ('log-like'), `dyrchatyy` ('holey'), `zubchatyy` ('toothed'), `materchatyy` ('fabric-like'), …

A number of compound adjectives allow formation with the participation of `-ist` and `-(ch)at`:

(716)
a. `tonkovoloknistyy` ('fine-fibered'), `melkoshchetinistyy` ('fine-bristled'), `tverdobugristyy` ('hard-hilly'), `beloperistyy` ('white-feathered'), `shirokovetvistyy` ('broad-branched'), `melkozernistyy` ('fine-grained'), …
b. `svetlobrevenchatyy` ('light-log-like'), `krupnodyrchatyy` ('large-holed'), `melkozubchatyy` ('fine-toothed'), `ostrozubchatyy` ('sharp-toothed'), `chernocheshuychatyy` ('black-scaled'), `melkotravchatyy` ('small-grass-like'), …

If, in these compound formations, the adjectives `voloknistyy` ('fibrous'), `shchetinistyy` ('bristly'), `bugristyy` ('hilly'); `brevenchatyy` ('log-like'), `dyrchatyy` ('holey'), `zubchatyy` ('toothed') were formed first, we would have the meanings 'thin and fibrous', 'small and bristly', 'hard and hilly'; 'light and log-like', 'large and holed', 'small and toothed' (this is precisely the order of derivation in coordination, see the next section). It is evident that the meaning of compound adjectives is structured differently: `tonkovoloknistyy` means 'with fine fibers', and `melkozubchatyy` means 'with small teeth', etc.

These suffixes, in principle, can also occur in coordination, but the order of meaning construction is different: `solnechno-mglistyy` ('sunny-misty'), `kamenisto-musornyy` ('stony-rubble') mean 'sunny and misty', 'stony and rubbishy'.

Thus, semantically, the direction of derivation in subordination corresponds to the combination of stems followed by the marking of the entire structure with a suffix. For the very same reason, the suffix change `khodovoy` ('running') - `bystrokhodnyy` ('fast-moving') (`-ov` → `-n`), `torgovyy` ('trade') - `novotorzhskiy` ('Novotorzh') (`-ov` → `-sk`), etc., occurs.

Note that a similar order of semantic derivation is also recognized for English derivational markers, cf.:

(717) English (Bolinger 1967: 29)
<!-- image -->
<!-- image -->
'author of regional novels' (from regional novel - 'regional novel')
'civil servant' (from public office - 'public office')

***

All the properties mentioned above, namely: i) suffix change; ii) absence of a simple correlate of the compound word; iii) stress change; iv) semantic change; v) derivation direction [[stem 1 - stem 2 ]-suffix], are observed in subordinate relations.

### Order of Derivation in Coordination.
In the case of a coordinative connection, we are dealing with the combination of already formed adjective stems. This follows from the fact that semantic derivation in coordination is structured inversely to what was described above for subordination. Here is what we find on this matter in (AG-80-1: § 754): "Compounds with stems of suffixal (desubstantival and deverbative) adjectives, as well as participles, are also semantically motivated as follows: 'relating equally to objects or processes named by the motivating stems of the forming adjectives': `nauchno-tekhnicheskiy` ('scientific-technical') (relating to science and technology), `priyemno-peredayushchiy` ('receiving-transmitting') (intended for reception and transmission)."

In coordination, both stems thus play an equal role in the compound word, combining into a single constituent, with each stem already containing its own morphology. This sequence corresponds to scheme (c), [[`kisl`] [`molokʹn`]], repeated below.

### 4.3.2.2. Order of Derivation of Russian Compound Adjectives: Summary

We are inclined to believe that behind the listed properties, which are defined in (AG-80-1: § 760) as a suffixal-compound method of word formation, lie two consecutive processes: i) the formation of a complex stem, and ii) the attachment of a suffix to such a constituent.

Above, we established that the sequence Adj1 + Adj2 + Suff differs from the sequence Adj2 + Suff by the following properties:

(718) Formation of Compound Adjectives vs. Formation of Adjectives from Second Stems
|                             | Adj1 + Adj2 + Suff   | Adj2 + Suff       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| i) suffix                   | `bystrokhodnyy`      | `khodovoy`        |
| ii) no original lexeme      | `odnonogiy`          | *`nogiy`          |
| iii) stress                 | `inozémnýy`          | `zemnóy`          |
| iv) semantics of second stem| `stodisyatisil'nyy`  | `sil'nyy`         |
| v) derivation order         | `tonkovoloknistyy`   | `voloknistyy`     |

All these facts indicate that the combination of two stems occurs first, and only then is the suffix attached: [[stem 1 - stem 2 ]-suffix].

The examination of the rules for forming Russian compound adjectives supports an approach that assumes binary branching – the sequential pairwise combination of elements. Binary branching is used in most modern syntactic theories based on constituent grammar (Carnie 2010: 120-121), largely precisely because it reflects the order of element combination, i.e., syntactic and semantic derivation.

Let us quote here the result obtained by A. A. Zaliznyak based on observations of Russian accentuation: "Step-by-step rules assume that the derivational history of any derivative is presented as a sequence of steps, at each of which one affix is attached to a root or a stem (i.e., a certain sequence of morphemes including the root) (in the case of compounding, the second stem acts as the affix). It is essential that for such a representation it is necessary to abandon the concept, used in certain cases in morphology, of simultaneous attachment of two or more morphemes to the root (stem) from the right and left (the so-called prefixal-suffixal method, for example, `bezloshadnyy` 'horseless', `obessakharit'` 'to desugar', the combination of compounding with suffixation, for example, `raznoyazychnyy` 'multi-language', and other combinations; see, in particular, AG-70, pp. 41-42). All such cases for accentological purposes must be presented as a chain of sequential binary connections" (Zaliznyak 2002: 420).

Based on the discussion above, we formulate the following rule for the formation of compound adjectives in Russian:

(719) Order of Derivation of Compound Words
In the case of a coordinative connection between stems, ready-made stems combine with each other. In the case of subordination, the stems first combine with each other, and then with the attributivizing morphology.

### 4.3.3. Constraints on Compound Word Formation
#### 4.3.3.1. Constraint on the Number of Branches within Compound Words

Below we will discuss one of the prohibitions on compound word formation, which distinguishes compound words from syntactic constituents.

Let's consider some productive models for forming compound adjectives, ordered by the type of constituent forming the compound word:

(720) Adj + N
`vysokogornyy` ('high-mountain'), `ravnobedrennyy` ('isosceles'), `legkoatleticheskiy` ('track-and-field'), `yuzhnoafrikanskiy` ('South African'), `glubokovodnyy` ('deep-water'), `sakharnosvekol'nyy` ('sugar beet'), `vysokoenergeticheskiy` ('high-energy'), …

(721) Num + N
`odnorazovyy` ('single-use'), `dvukhyarusnyy` ('two-tiered'), `dvu(kh)toplivnyy` ('dual-fuel'), `chetyrekhkolesnyy` ('four-wheeled'), …
`pervoklassnyy` ('first-class'), `vtorosortnyy` ('second-rate'), `tret'estepennyy` ('third-rate'), …

(722) a. V + DO (Verb + Direct Object)
`vodootvodnyy` ('water-diverting'), `kormozagotovitel'nyy` ('fodder-procuring'), `tenevynoslivyy` ('shade-tolerant'), …
`zvukovosproizvodyashchiy` ('sound-reproducing'), `metalloobrabatyvayushchiy` ('metal-processing'), `nefteperekachivayushchiy` ('oil-pumping'), …

b. V + IO (Verb + Indirect Object)
`elektroosvetitel'nyy` ('electric-lighting'), `puleneprobivayemyy` ('bulletproof'), `energopitayemyy` ('energy-powered'), `elektroupravlyayemyy` ('electrically-controlled'), …
`elektrodvizhushchiy` ('electric-driving'), `toplivosnabzhayushchiy` ('fuel-supplying'), `knigotorguyushchiy` ('book-trading'), `domovladeyushchiy` ('house-owning'), …

c. V + PP (Verb + Prepositional Phrase)
`sudokhodnyy` ('navigable'), `morekhodnyy` ('seaworthy'), `vodoplav(atel')nyy` ('aquatic'), `tsentro-bezhnyy` ('centrifugal'), …
`vodoplavayushchiy` ('water-swimming'), `vozdukhoplavayushchiy` ('air-faring'), `zemlekhodyashchiy` ('ground-walking'), …

(723) P + N (Preposition + Noun)
`primorskiy` ('coastal'), `postrochnyy` ('line-by-line'), `zaoblachnyy` ('beyond-the-clouds'), `nastennyy` ('wall-mounted'), `pridorozhnyy` ('roadside'), `mezhdunarodnyy` ('international'), `posleobedennyy` ('post-lunch'), …

Let's ask the following question: is it possible to form compound adjectives using more than one model? The examples below are the result of combining several models from the previous section at once:

(724) a. Num + Adj + N
*`dvukhvysokoyarusnyy` ('*two-high-tiered'), *`trekhravnostoronniy` ('*three-equilateral'), *`mnogoraznoznachnyy` ('*many-multi-meaning')

b. DO: Adj + N + V (Direct Object: Adjective + Noun + Verb)
*`glubokovodootvodnyy` ('*deep-water-diverting'), *`sakharnosveklosagotovitel'nyy` ('*sugar-beet-procuring'), *`tsel'nometalloobrabatyvayushchiy` ('*all-metal-processing')

c. IO: Num/Adj + N + V (Indirect Object: Numeral/Adjective + Noun + Verb)
*`vysokoenergozavisimyy` ('*high-energy-dependent'), *`dvu(kh)domovladeyushchiy` ('*two-house-owning'), *`dvu(kh)topliv(n)osnabzhayushchiy` ('*two-fuel-supplying')

d. P + Num/Adj + N (Preposition + Numeral/Adjective + Noun)
*`zabelooblachnyy` ('*behind-white-cloudy'), *`prikrasnomorskiy` ('*near-red-sea'), *`nadvustennyy` ('*on-two-walled')

e. PP + V/Adj (Prepositional Phrase + Verb/Adjective)
*`zamorekhodnyy` ('*for-seaworthy'), *`otsentrobezhnyy` ('*from-centrifugal'), *`nasudokhodnyy` ('*on-navigable') vs. ok `morekhodnyy` ('seaworthy'), ok `tsentrobezhnyy` ('centrifugal'), ok `sudokhodnyy` ('navigable')

In (a), an attempt was made to combine a numeral, an adjective, and a noun in a compound word. While individual compound words like `dvukhyarusnyy` ('two-tiered') / `vysokoyarusnyy` ('high-tiered'), `trekhstoronniy` ('three-sided') / `ravnostoronniy` ('equilateral'), `mnogoznachnyy` ('multi-meaning') / `raznoznachnyy` ('different-meaning'), as well as noun phrases like `dva vysokikh yarusa` ('two high tiers'), `tri ravnykh storony` ('three equal sides'), `mnogo raznykh znacheniy` ('many different meanings') are grammatical, the resulting compound word turns out to be ungrammatical.

Similarly in (b): while individual compound words like `glubokovodnyy` ('deep-water') / `vodootvodnyy` ('water-diverting') etc., and syntactic combinations of a verb and an expanded direct object like `otvodit' glubokuyu vodu` ('to divert deep water') etc. are grammatical, the supposed three-part compound word turns out to be ungrammatical.

- In (c), we have a combination of an adjective and a noun forming a noun phrase, which in turn falls into the position of an indirect object. While individual compound words and syntactic constructions are grammatical, a three-part compound word again turns out to be impossible.

In (d) and (e), formations involving prepositional phrases are given. In (d), combinations of a preposition, adjective or numeral, and a head noun turn out to be ungrammatical, cf. `belooblachnyy` ('white-cloudy') / `zaoblachnyy` ('beyond-the-clouds'), `za belym oblakom` ('behind a white cloud'), but *`zabelooblachnyy`.

- In (e), a rather interesting contrast is presented between ungrammatical combinations of prepositions, nouns, and the verbs governing them (*`zamorekhodnyy`, *`otsentrobezhnyy`, *`nasudokhodnyy`) and a perfectly acceptable combination of the same elements with the same meaning, where the preposition, however, is omitted (`morekhodnyy`, `tsentrobezhnyy`, `sudokhodnyy`).

The list of productive models presented above indicates that compound words are formed according to the same rules as noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases. Moreover, the interpretation of compound words follows the same rules as the interpretation of their corresponding syntactic units⁵⁷.

Thus, for example, in cases like `glubokovodnyy` ('deep-water'), `dvukhyarusnyy` ('two-tiered'), the relations between the second and first stems represent a semantic pair "modifier - predicate," while in cases like `vodootvodnyy` ('water-diverting'), `vodosnabzhayushchiy` ('water-supplying'), they represent "argument - predicate." The composition rules here are exactly the same as in the syntax of the original constituents: `glubokovodnyy` means, for example, not 'deep and filled with water', but 'that which is found / used / … in deep water'. Similarly, `vodootvodnyy` corresponds not to the meaning 'water that diverts', but 'that which diverts water'.

So: i) compound words are based on syntactic constituents of a certain type; ii) combinations of more than two compound word formation models are impossible, in other words – each compound word cannot include more than one constituent.

We can formulate the following observation:

(725) Constraint on the Number of Branches in Compound Words
Compound words can only be formed at a syntactic embedding level equal to one:
a. Derivation with two stems is acceptable:
<!-- image -->

b. * Derivation with three stems:
<!-- image -->

It might seem that in some cases, our generalization is violated. The first potential exception is represented by cases where a coordination relation can be observed between individual stems forming a compound word:

(726) (internet)
a. `A mozhet li byt' vkus sladko-soleno-gor'ko-kislo-pryanyy?`
   'And can the taste be sweet-salty-bitter-sour-spicy?'
b. `Tsel'yu issledovaniy stavilos' izucheniye malotsiklovoy vy-noslivosti derevozhelezobetonnykh izgibayemykh elementov v zone sovmestnogo deystviya.`
   'The aim of the research was to study the low-cycle fatigue of wood-reinforced concrete bending elements in the zone of combined action.'

However, in the formulation presented above, the prohibition on the number of branches is not violated here. Indeed, despite the fact that each of the examples above contains three or more stems, the syntactic structure of the entire constituent is "flat," as the individual stems within it are coordinated and none is a head for another. The requirement to have no more than one branch is thus satisfied:

(727) <!-- image -->

The same applies to more complex examples:

(728) `pylevlagonepronitsayemyy` ('dust-and-moisture-impermeable'), `vodogryazeottalkivayushchiy` ('water-and-dirt-repellent'), …

In cases like `sladko-soleno-gor'ko-kislo-pryanyy` ('sweet-salty-bitter-sour-spicy') and `derevozhelezobetonnyy` ('wood-reinforced concrete'), subordinate relations are completely absent, i.e., all participants are equal, and none is a head for another. In cases like `pylevlagonepronitsayemyy` ('dust-and-moisture-impermeable'), `vodogryazeottalkivayushchiy` ('water-and-dirt-repellent'), etc., there is one (and only one) branching embedded under the derivational marker. In such constructions, the coordinated group depends on a common head:

(729) <!-- image -->

Thus, the prescription to have no more than one branching is also met in this case. Another type of exception is represented by complex numerals in combination with nouns:

(730) `devyanostotrekhetniy` ('ninety-three-year-old'), `stodvadtsatigrammovyy` ('one-hundred-and-twenty-gram'), …

However, it seems to us that complex numerals constitute a single word, i.e., all their components actually represent one stem, not several. This can be shown as follows. Ordinal numerals are formed from complex numerals without any restrictions:

(731) `devyanostotretiy` ('ninety-third'), `stodvadtsatyy` ('one-hundred-and-twentieth'), `dve tysyachi pyatnadtsatyy` ('two thousand fifteenth') …

At the same time, no other stems, apart from numeral stems, can form ordinal numerals; for example, combinations of prepositions / modifiers with numerals are ungrammatical:

(732) *`okolodevyanostyy` ('*about-ninetieth'), *`pochtidvadtsatyy` ('*almost-twentieth'), *`primernodesyatyy` ('*approximately-tenth') …

Ordinal numerals, which can be formed from both single-stem numerals and from numerals with two or more stems, show us that a combination of several numeral stems is formed in the lexicon and actually represents one (and not several) stems, cf. also `odinnadtsat'` ('eleven'), `dvenadtsat'` ('twelve'), etc. Cases like `devyanostotrekhetniy` ('ninety-three-year-old'), etc., therefore, are also not exceptions to the limitation formulated above.

Let's discuss the reasons for the constraint on the number of branches. Syntax is endocentric, i.e., it operates with constituents of a specific category. This follows from the combinatorial properties of elements. When each new element is included in derivation, it must "know" with which unit⁵⁸ of which category it is to combine. Such "knowledge" is crucial only for structures with more than two elements. If there are two elements, each can be at the word level, X⁰, since there will be no "governing" third element above them to whom they need to "report" on "who is in charge here."

⁵⁸ "Unit" (head or phrase), not "units," because syntactic branching is binary.

As soon as a third element appears, it becomes necessary for it to "see from the outside" with whom it is dealing. Therefore, when two stems combine, both can be X⁰, but when they combine with a third, it can only be XP. This last requirement contradicts the fact that, in our case, the process takes place in morphology. Elements of morphology, i.e., various types of affixes, operate only with units of category X⁰. If they are "fed" an XP, they "break down," which leads to the constraint on the number of branches.

It should be noted that languages vary in this parameter. For some, such as Russian or Lithuanian, the constraint on branching in morphology is relevant. Others, such as German or Sanskrit, operate by different rules. Another type of language "without constraints" on morphological elements is polysynthetic (Abkhaz-Adyghe, Salishan, etc.). Here, however, we are discussing languages like Russian.

### 4.3.3.2. Constraint on the Direction of Branching

Based on the compound adjective examples given above, the following constraint can also be formulated, see also (ONS 2011: 111-113) and sources cited therein:

(733) Observation on the Constraint on Branching Direction
All dependents in compound words are located to the left of the head.

In the case of noun phrases, the arrangement of head and dependent elements in compound words coincides with that for word forms in syntax:

(734)
`vysokaya gora` ('high mountain') → `vysokogornyy` ('high-mountain')
`chetyre kolesa` ('four wheels') → `chetyrekhkolesnyy` ('four-wheeled')
`malo vetvey` ('few branches') → `malovetvistyy` ('sparse-branched')
`vsya Rossiya` ('all Russia') → `vserossiyskiy` ('all-Russian')

However, in the case of a verb phrase, the order in compound words and in the syntax of constituents clearly do not coincide. While in simple predication, direct and indirect objects, as well as circumstantial adjuncts, are located to the right of the verb, in compound words we again find left branching:

(735)
`otvodit' vodu` ('to divert water') → `vodootvodnyy` ('water-diverting') vs. *`otvodovodnyy`
`probivat' puley` ('to pierce with a bullet') → `puleneprobivayemyy` ('bulletproof') vs. *`neprobivayemopulevoy`
`khodit' na sudakh` ('to travel by ships') → `sudokhodnyy` ('navigable') vs. *`khodosudovoy`

Let's show that rightward branching indeed occurs in the verb phrase. This can be demonstrated, for example, with objects expressed by syntactic elements that have scope. With VO order, the sentences below have two interpretations: i) 'three (any) apples were not eaten' (e.g., two were eaten) - the so-called wide scope of negation, and ii) 'there are some specific three apples, and they are not eaten' - wide scope of the object quantifier:

(736)
a. `Petya ne s'yel tri yabloka.`
   'Petya did not eat three apples.'
   i) Neg > 3, ii) 3 > Neg
b. `Petya tri yabloka ne s'yel.`
   'Petya three apples not ate.'
   i) * Neg > 3, ii) 3 > Neg

In the case of VO order, both readings are available; in the case of OV, only one, with the wide scope of the object quantifier. It is commonly assumed that scope "freezing" occurs in cases where the syntactic group has already undergone movement, see (Antonyuk-Yudina 2009). Thus, the order with object postposition can be considered basic for Russian, while the order with preposition is obtained as a result of syntactic derivation.

So, if the model for forming a compound word is a verb phrase, branching in compound words is leftward, not rightward, as in syntax. A similar situation applies to deadjectival derivatives like `morozoustoychivyy` ('frost-resistant'), `energoemkiy` ('energy-intensive'), `vlagostoykiy` ('moisture-resistant'), `solntsydostupnyy` ('sun-accessible'), `trudosposobnyy` ('able-bodied'), etc. – their second parts also represent heads located to the right of their dependents.

If we indeed observe consistent left branching in compound words, regardless of the branching direction in "full" syntax, the following can be asserted: i) during compound word formation, it is known which of the stems is the head and which is the dependent; ii) during compound word formation, certain rules for ordering the head and dependent are applied, which differ from those in syntax. Let's examine these and some other problems in order.

In accordance with the ideas of one of the most influential theories of formal morphology, so-called Distributed Morphology, roots are always acategorial. Within Distributed Morphology, it is assumed that categorical features are acquired by stems during derivation. This occurs as a result of zero categorical markers (N, V) combining with an acategorial root: [N  [√hand]]; [V  [√hand]].

H. Borer, see (Borer 2005a; 2005b; 2014a; 2014b), also assumes the existence of a syntactic structure "all the way down," right to the root, but nevertheless approaches the question of categorical marking differently. One of Borer's observations is that secondary attachment of a zero derivational marker to a phonologically non-empty derivational morpheme is impossible, cf.: *`to salutation`, *`a crystalize` (Borer 2014b). This casts doubt on the existence of zero recategorizers. Indeed, suppose there are examples where from the stem [√hand] one can derive the noun `a hand` or the verb `to hand`. Then one might ask why the marker [V ] cannot produce the verb *`to salutation` from the stem `salutation`, and the marker [N ] cannot produce the noun *`a crystalize` from the stem `crystalize`? This forces Borer to doubt the reality of zero recategorizing elements [n ], [v ], and so on.

Another remark by Borer is conceptual in nature – having two productive zero morphemes ([n ] and [v ]) with opposite functions is not entirely acceptable. Especially if we require our system to satisfy the principle of economy – one of the basic principles of modern generative grammar (and Distributed Morphology).

The necessity of categorical markers is justified by the concept of so-called syntactic selection (c-selection, where c stands for category, constituent, etc.), see (Grimshaw 2005). Indeed, from where, for example, does a verb get the information that it combines with nominal projections (in a specific case)? Information about syntactic selection must evidently be contained in some form already in the stem – it is precisely a property of the stem to be able to attach a dependent of a certain category and in a certain case:

(737) `reshit' / zadumat' progulyat'sya` ('to decide / to conceive of taking a walk') [V,INF] vs. `predlozhit' / rekomendovat' progulku` ('to offer / to recommend a walk') [N,DAT]

Note that the ability to attach a dependent of a certain category does not change when a word form shifts to another lexical class, meaning it is truly a property of the stem:

(738) `resheniye / zadumka progulyat'sya` ('decision / idea to take a walk') [V,INF] vs. `predlozheniye / rekomendatsiya progulki` ('offer / recommendation of a walk') [V,INF]

The root, therefore, somehow already possesses information about the constituent it will attach, namely – the type of its projection (infinitive phrase / noun phrase), case, etc. The requirement for a specific case, however, is relevant for syntax, where XP-constituents (phrases) exist as a consequence of the Case Filter and similar principles, see (Lyutikova 2017a). At the morphological level, there is only the requirement for combination with an element of a specific category (V, N, …).

Thus, the consistently asymmetric arrangement of heads and dependents allows us to state that i) the actual "head - dependent" relation is determined at the very beginning of derivation, at the level of X⁰ elements; ii) roots (of dependent X⁰s) already possess categorical affiliation.

### 4.3.3.3. Constraint on Head Coordination

Let's discuss another regularity that is quite consistent and thus may be interesting from the perspective of seeking rules for the structure of compound words. In compound adjectives consisting of a head and a dependent, formations with coordination of dependent elements are quite productive:

(739) (internet)
`cherno-i zheltolitsyy` ('black- and yellow-faced'), `dvukh-i chetyrekhkolesnyy` ('two- and four-wheeled'), `stale-i chugunoliteynyy` ('steel- and cast-iron-casting'), `vodo-i gazosnabzhayushchiy` ('water- and gas-supplying'), `vodo-i vozdukhonepronitsayemyy` ('water- and air-impermeable'), `vysoko-i sredneoplachivayemyy` ('highly- and moderately-paid'), …

In this example, we observe coordination between different types of dependents: adjectives and numerals within a noun phrase, direct and indirect objects, as well as circumstantials within a verb phrase. Such a property – the ability to coordinate – itself testifies to the syntactic organization of compound adjectives.

However, the following constraint on coordination in compound adjectives can be formulated. Namely, compound adjectives that have a common dependent with two heads appear ungrammatical:

(740)
a. *`chernoglaz-i litsyy` ('*black-eyed-and-faced'), *`chernoglazyy i litsyy` ('*black-eyed and faced')
b. *`dvukhkoles(n)-i mestnyy` ('*two-wheeled-and-local'), *`dvukhkolesnyy i mestnyy` ('*two-wheeled and local')
c. *`staleplavil'(n)-i liteynyy` ('*steel-smelting-and-foundry'), *`staleplavil'nyy i liteynyy` ('*steel-smelting and foundry')
d. *`vodosnabzha(yushch)-i zapasayushchiy` ('*water-supplying-and-stockpiling'), *`vodosnabzhayushchiy i zapasayushchiy` ('*water-supplying and stockpiling')
e. *`vozdukhonepronitsa(yem)-i napolnyayemyy` ('*air-impermeable-and-fillable'), *`vozdukhonepronitsayemyy i napolnyayemyy` ('*air-impermeable and fillable')
f. *`vysokokvalifitsirova(nn)-i oplachivayemyy` ('*highly-qualified-and-paid'), *`vysokokvalifitsirovannyy i oplachivayemyy` ('*highly-qualified and paid')

The same applies to words of other parts of speech, cf.: *`neftepererabotka i prodazha` ('*oil-processing and sale'). The following observation can be formulated:

(741) Constraint on Head Coordination
In compound word formation, only coordination of dependents is permissible, while coordination of heads is impossible.

Thus, in the domain of coordination, we find the following regularities: i) coordination of dependent elements is possible (`dvukh-i chetyrekhkolesnyy` 'two- and four-wheeled'); ii) coordination of head elements is impossible (*`dvukhkoles(n)-i mestnyy` '*two-wheeled-and-local').

### 4.3.4. Adjectival and Attributive Derivation in Russian: Summary

We have established that Russian compound adjectives are based on syntactic constituents of a certain type. Moreover, combinations of more than two adjective formation models are impossible. As we have shown, this is because the resulting adjectives cannot contain phrasal-level units. This distinguishes Russian compound adjectives from attributivization in Altaic and Dagestanian languages. At the same time, the very fact of having various productive models of adjectivization and attributivization makes Russian similar to languages with XP-attributivization. Russian possesses the same derivational potential, simply forming new elements not in syntax, but in the lexicon.

We also established that dependents in compound words are always located to the left of their head. From this last fact, we concluded that the "head - dependent" relation is already determined at the pre-lexical level. We also concluded that stems, by this point, already possess a certain categorical affiliation. The latter statement is consistent with the results of the analysis of Ossetian complex predicates, see section 3.2.
The ability to coordinate and the constraints imposed on the resulting word forms also attest to the syntactic nature of compound adjectives. In coordination, it also proves critical which element is the head and which is the dependent.

Russian compound adjectives are formed in the lexicon. However, their formation rules are essentially a separate syntactic submodule with its own principles and constraints. Thus, the "X⁰-syntax" observed in Russian compound adjectives is analogous to the XP-syntax of languages with XP-attributivization.

Potentially permissible complex formations as nominal modifiers are formed in Russian as lexicon units, not syntactic units. The reason for this is as follows: the Russian language has gone quite "far" in the development of the adjective category. Russian has a rich arsenal of derivational means, i.e., morphology that assigns the feature Adj or Atr. The need for Russian to attributivize via a syntactic head A is, therefore, minimal. Nevertheless, as we will see below, this model also exists in Russian. In the concluding section, we will discuss cases of constituent attributivization related to the so-called genitive of quality.

## 4.4. The Genitive of Quality as a Bearer of the Attributive Feature

Here we will discuss the properties and structure of non-agreeing attributes somewhat unusual for the Russian language – the so-called genitives of quality. There are not many studies on the syntax of genitives of quality; see, for example, (Trugman 2005) and other works. We will try to understand why genitives of quality differ so much in their properties from "ordinary" possessive genitives and to establish what role the adjective plays in their structure. Simultaneously, we will develop the idea of an attributive head A.

## 4.4.1. The Genitive of Quality as a Special Type of Nominal Constituents

A series of non-referential uses are contrasted with the possessive genitive, one of which is the so-called genitive of quality, see (Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2005; Partee, Borschev 2012) and the references cited therein.

The following examples can demonstrate the genitive of quality in Russian:

(742) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
a. `Dlya detey starshego vozrasta.`
   'For children of older age.'
b. `Parket izurodovan obuglennymi vdavlindami strannoy okrugloy formy.`
   'The parquet is disfigured by charred indentations of a strange rounded shape.'
c. `Abalkin - velikolepnyy spetsialist, uchenyy vysokogo klassa, ya lichno vstrechalsya s nim…`
   'Abalkin is an excellent specialist, a high-class scientist, I personally met him…'

In (Partee, Borschev 2012), the genitive of quality is proposed to be viewed as a construction consisting of a parametric noun (`rost` 'height', `tsvet` 'color', …) and an adjective that establishes the value of the parameter (`vysokiy` 'high', `zelenyy` 'green', …). Cases of non-parametric nouns, such as material designations used in the same function, are analyzed by the authors as a change in semantic type or coercion. Specifically, nouns that specify a parameter are categorized by the authors as nouns of a so-called functional type. In the following examples, however, we find nouns of a distinctly different semantic type, so-called "sortal nouns," in the parameter position:

(743) (From the works of A. and B. Strugatsky)
`Ob"yekt «Pyatno-96» vblizi pokhozh na gigantskuyu starinnuyu shkatulku golubogo khrustalya…`
'Object "Spot-96" up close resembles a giant antique box of blue crystal…'

(744) (From the works of M. A. Bulgakov)
`Pervoye, chto zametilos', - dragotsennaya mebel' karel'skoy berezy…`
'The first thing that was noticed was the precious Karelian birch furniture…'

According to B. Partee and V. B. Borschev, what we see here is a change in semantic type. Nouns like `khrustal'` 'crystal' and `bereza` 'birch' must shift to a functional (relational) noun type and acquire the property of expressing a parameter, similar to nouns like `rost` 'height', `tsvet` 'color', etc.

If one attempts to develop this idea (the authors merely outlined general analytical features), one could hypothesize that `mebel' karel'skoy berezy` 'Karelian birch furniture' is interpreted as follows: any object of the 'furniture' class, among other physical parameters (height, width, weight, …), also has a 'material' parameter, one of whose values is 'a certain type of wood'. If this were the case, the genitive of quality could be found in the following noun phrases:

(745)
# `stol berezy`
'birch table' (pragmatically infelicitous)
# `lampa khrustalya`
'crystal lamp' (pragmatically infelicitous)
# `kreslo sosny`
'pine armchair' (pragmatically infelicitous)
# `perila zolota`
'gold railings' (pragmatically infelicitous)

As we can see, these examples are ungrammatical – in the absence of an adjective, they acquire a new (non-qualitative) meaning, difficult to correlate with objects of extra-linguistic reality.

At the same time, each of the dependents in the genitive case possesses a sufficient degree of specification for the 'material' parameter to serve as a modifier for the object they modify, forming the MATERIAL class adjectives we have already discussed:

(746)
`berezovyy stol`
'birch table'
`khrustal'naya lampa`
'crystal lamp'
`sosnovoye kreslo`
'pine armchair'
`zolotyye perila`
'gold railings'

Nevertheless, noun phrases with a genitive of quality used without an adjective (745) turn out to be unacceptable, cf. the label "construction with an obligatory third member" from (Borschev, Knorina 1990). Thus, the constraint on an "obligatory third element," first identified in (Borschev, Knorina 1990), appears not to be explainable solely by semantics.

The genitive of quality, which was presumably borrowed into Russian and other European languages through Biblical texts, was already noted in Latin:

(747) Latin (de Groot 1956: 30)
`homo magnae eloquentiae`
man great.GEN eloquence.GEN
'a man of great eloquence'

In English or French, it can be formed without the participation of an adjective:

(748) English (internet)
a. The man of power welcomes conflict…
b. Men of Dignity: The Montagnards of South-Vietnam
c. We need soldiers of courage to stand up for the institution…

(749) French (internet)
a. Pierre était un homme de puissance…
b. Seigneur, où sont les hommes de dignité?
c. visage de jeune fille de beauté aux yeux bleus et lèvres roses

At the same time, Russian analogues of such uses are ungrammatical:

(750)
* `chelovek sily`
'*man of strength'
* `chelovek dostoinstva`
'*man of dignity'
* `soldaty otvagi`
'*soldiers of courage'
* `chelovek mogushchestva`
'*man of power'
* `chelovek dostoinstva`
'*man of dignity'
* `lyudi talanta`
'*people of talent'
* `devushka krasoty`
'*girl of beauty'

A possible argument from proponents of the semantic approach would be that Russian parametric nouns like `sila` 'strength', `rost` 'height', `tsvet` 'color', `vid` 'kind', `vysota` 'height', etc., do not convey a specific value of the parameter. Indeed, the listed nouns do not express the degree of manifestation of the feature, cf.:

(751)
a. `bol'shoy / sredney / maloy sily`
   'of great / medium / small strength'
b. `vysokogo / srednego / nizkogo rosta`
   'of high / medium / low height'

This argument, however, is not applicable in the case of nouns such as `glupost'` 'stupidity', `vazhnost'` 'importance', `podlost'` 'meanness', `mogushchestvo` 'power', `krasota` 'beauty', etc. When used without an adjective indicating the degree of manifestation of the feature, these nouns are perfectly capable of conveying the maximum position on the scale they define. At the same time, the following examples without an apostrophe turn out to be ungrammatical in Russian:

| (752) | a. | * `sovety gluposti` | vs. | a′. | `…sovety kosmicheskogo masshtaba i kosmicheskoy zhe gluposti.` |
|-------|----|--------------------|-----|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|       |    | '*advice of stupidity' |     |     | '…advice of cosmic scale and cosmic stupidity.'               |
|       | b. | * `delo vazhnosti` | vs. | b′. | `Delo chrezvychaynoy vazhnosti, uveryayu tebya…`              |
|       |    | '*matter of importance' |     |     | 'A matter of extreme importance, I assure you…'               |
|       | c. | * `postupok podlosti` | vs. | c′. | `…poshel na redkoy podlosti postupok…`                        |
|       |    | '*act of meanness' |     |     | '…committed an act of rare meanness…'                         |
|       | d. | * `lampa mogushchestva` | vs. | d′. | `…valyalas' beskhoznaya lampa nevidannogo mogushchestva.`     |
|       |    | '*lamp of power' |     |     | '…an ownerless lamp of unseen power was lying around.'        |
|       | e. | * `vspyshka krasoty` | vs. | e′. | `Vspyshka byla segodnya krasoty izumitel'noy.`                |
|       |    | '*flash of beauty' |     |     | 'The flash today was of amazing beauty.'                      |

As we can see, sufficiently specified nouns denoting material (`berezy` 'birch', `khrustalya` 'crystal', …) and a high manifestation of a feature (`gluposti` 'stupidity', `mogushchestva` 'power', …) cannot form constructions with a genitive of quality in Russian. This distinguishes the Russian genitive of quality from analogous constructions in some other languages. Thus, it can be argued that an explanation for the obligatoriness of the adjective in the Russian genitive of quality, based solely on semantics, does not work.

It should be noted that noun phrases in some other Slavic languages behave similarly:

(753) Serbian
a. * `devojka lepote`
   * girl beauty.GEN
   '*girl of beauty'
a′. `devojka neverovatne / posebne lepote`
    girl unbelievable.GEN / special.GEN beauty.GEN
    'a girl of unbelievable / special beauty'
b. * `čovek hrabrosti`
   * man courage.GEN
   '*man of courage'
b′. `čovek neopisive / izuzetne hrabrosti`
    man indescribable.GEN / exceptional.GEN courage.GEN
    'a man of indescribable / exceptional courage'

(754) Polish
a. * `dziewczyna piękności`
   * girl beauty.GEN
   '*girl of beauty'
a′. `dziewczyna wielkiej piękności`
    girl great.GEN beauty.GEN
    'a girl of amazing (= great) beauty'
b. * `człowiek hojności`
   * man generosity.GEN
   '*man of generosity'
b′. `człowiek wielkiej hojności`
    man great.GEN generosity.GEN
    'a man of great (= great) generosity'
c. * `żołnierz odwagi`
   * soldier courage.GEN
   '*soldier of courage'
c′. `żołnierz wielkiej odwagi`
    soldier great.GEN courage.GEN
    'a soldier of rare (= great) courage'

Below we will try to find a syntactic justification for this prohibition. To do this, we will first consider some properties of the Russian genitive of quality that make it similar to adjectives, and then propose an analysis that explains these adjectival properties and the obligatoriness of the adjective.

## 4.4.2. The Genitive of Quality and the Adjective

Here we will discuss the distribution of the genitive of quality and show that it is analogous to the distribution of the adjective.

### 4.4.2.1. Prepositive Use

The genitive of quality permits prepositive use alongside postposition:

(755) (Grashchenkov 2006: 78)
a. `vse eti potryasayushchey roskoshi staryye izdaniya`
   'all these old editions of astounding luxury'
b. `Eti ogromnyye, potryasayushchey sinevy glaza prosto nevozmozhno zabyt'.`
   'These enormous, astounding blue eyes are simply unforgettable.'
c. `v yeyo uditel'noy krasoty Kafedral'nom sobore`
   'in her amazingly beautiful Cathedral'
d. `Posmotreli, povzdykhali nad potryasayushchego kachestva kartinkoy…`
   'They looked, sighed over the picture of astounding quality…'

This is impossible for other types of genitive Noun Phrases:

(756) (Grashchenkov 2006: 107)
a. * `On narisoval svoyego starshego brata portret.`
   '*He drew his older brother a portrait.'
b. * `Vo vremya remonta on isportil soseda dver'.`
   '*During the renovation, he ruined the neighbor's door.'
c. * `On ugostil menya vina bokalom.`
   '*He treated me to a glass of wine.'

Under certain conditions (intonational prominence of the adjective), it is possible for the genitive of quality to be placed between the adjective and the noun:

(757) (internet)
a. `Yego i bez togo ogromnyye, nebesnoy sinevy glaza, kotorykh ne kosnulsya vozrast, stali yeshche bol'she ot neozhidannosti otveta.`
   'His already enormous, sky-blue eyes, untouched by age, grew even larger from the unexpected answer.'
b. `…odnako, kogda on razglyadel etu tvar' kak sleduyet i obnaruzhil, chto ona podobna ogromnoy, gnusnogo vida obez'yane.`
   '…however, when he examined this creature properly and discovered that it was like a huge, vile-looking ape.'
c. `Unikal'nyye, prevoskhodnogo kachestva fotografii s neobkhodimoy komp'yuternoy obrabotkoy izobrazheniya.`
   'Unique, excellent quality photos with necessary computer image processing.'

### 4.4.2.2. Coordination

In a number of languages, the genitive has a wide range of non-referential uses and can be coordinated with an adjective:

(758) Lithuanian (Grashchenkov 2006: 80)
`rankų ir protinis darbas`
hand-GEN and mental work
'physical (= manual) and mental labor'

The Russian possessive genitive, however, cannot be coordinated with adjectives regardless of their position:

(759)
a. * `moyego druga i novyy dom`
   '*my friend's and new house'
b. * `dom moyego druga i novyy`
   '*house of my friend and new'

At the same time, the genitive of quality freely coordinates with an adjective:

(760) (Grashchenkov 2006: 219)
a. `bol'shiye i potryasayushchego kachestva ekrany`
   'large and astounding quality screens'
b. `ogromnyye i vsegda otlichnogo kachestva fotografii`
   'enormous and always excellent quality photos'
c. `belokuryye, dlinnogolovyye i vysokogo rosta elliny`
   'blond, long-headed and tall Hellenes'
d. `Draku vozle tribunoy zateyut verzily, a s granatoy i drugim oruzhiyem budut malen'kiye, nevzrachnyye i gnusnogo vida.`
   'Big guys will start a fight near the tribune, and small, unattractive, and vile-looking ones will have grenades and other weapons.'

The ability of the genitive of quality to coordinate with adjectives and the inability of the possessive genitive to do so indicate a similarity in the syntactic properties of the genitive of quality and the adjective (and differences between the possessive and qualitative genitives).

### 4.4.2.3. Possibility of Using More Than One Genitive Dependent

Another important property contrasting the genitive of quality and the referential possessive genitive is the impossibility of using several referential genitives within a single noun phrase:

(761)
* `Petin sharf mamy`
  '*Petya's scarf of mother'
* `sharf Peti mamy`
  '*scarf of Petya of mother'
* `Petin mamin sharf`
  '*Petya's mother's scarf'

Such a construction is syntactically impossible, even if an adequate pragmatic interpretation could be offered for it. For example, if a mother gave or knitted a scarf for Petya, this example still remains ungrammatical⁵⁹. Such behavior of referential genitive groups corresponds well to the observation formulated in (Kolliaku 1999) as the Nominal Denotation Hypothesis:

(762) Nominal Denotation Hypothesis (Kolliaku 1999)
A head noun can be marked by at most one referential genitive group and at most one property-specifying genitive group⁶⁰.

The use of more than one genitive of quality in Russian is perfectly permissible. Thus, the second part of the "nominal denotation hypothesis" is refuted by Russian data:

⁵⁹ Cf., however, so-called picture nouns: `Mashin portret Peti` ('Masha's portrait of Petya') or cases like `sbornaya Rossii Olega Romantseva` ('Oleg Romantsev's Russian national team'). In these examples, however, the ability to attach more than one possessive dependent is predetermined by the lexical semantics of the head.

⁶⁰ "A noun head can take at most one individual de-phrase and at most one property de-phrase"; in the cited work, it refers to French possessors which are encoded by the preposition `de`.

(763) (internet)
a. `Gostinaya obstavlyayetsya mebel'yu natural'nogo dereva temnogo tsveta.`
   'The living room is furnished with dark-colored natural wood furniture.'
b. `Krupno-ulichnyy fonar' belogo tsveta strannoy formy na fone neba.`
   'A large street lamp of white color and strange shape against the sky.'

In the overwhelming majority of noun phrases (see, however, footnote 59 above), the genitive can be assigned to only one dependent. The violation of this rule in the case of the genitive of quality is due to its different syntactic nature. This property brings the genitive of quality closer to the adjective.

### 4.4.2.4. Predicative Use

The genitive of quality is freely permissible both with a nominal copula (764) and in the position of a secondary predicate (765):

(764) (Grashchenkov 2006: 219)
a. `Petya byl vysokogo rosta, korenast i shirokoplech.`
   'Petya was tall, stocky, and broad-shouldered.'
b. `Devushka byla udavitel'noy krasoty.`
   'The girl was of amazing beauty.'
c. `Udar byl strashnoy sily.`
   'The blow was of terrible force.'

(765) (internet)
a. `Chto predprinyat', chtoby rebenok vyros vysokogo rosta.`
   'What to do to make a child grow tall.'
b. `Zhivopistsy izobrazhayut ellinov belokurymi, dlinnogolovymi i vysokogo rosta.`
   'Painters depict Hellenes as blond, long-headed, and tall.'
c. `Pravda, fel'dkurata ya predstavlyal sebe boleye vysokogo rosta…`
   'Truth be told, I imagined the field chaplain to be taller…'

Here, the genitive of quality again resembles adjectives, for which predicative use is as typical as their use as a nominal modifier. In this case, a contrast with some (but not all) types of genitive is also observed. While the possessive genitive is in principle permissible as a nominal complement of an existential copula (766), the partitive genitive is not inclined to function in this role (767); see also (Grashchenkov 2006):

(766) (internet)
`Mashina byla ne moyego ottsa, ona prednaznachalas' dlya vysokogo nachal'stva.`
'The car was not my father's; it was intended for high-ranking officials.'

(767) (Grashchenkov 2006: 218)
a. * `Vedro (bylo) kartoshki.`
   '*A bucket (was) of potatoes.'
b. * `Stakan (byl) vody.`
   '*A glass (was) of water.'

## 4.4.3. Adjunction

The following properties bring the genitive of quality closer to the adjective and make it unlike the possessive and other types of nominal genitives: i) prepositive use; ii) coordination with adjectives; iii) possibility of multiple genitives of quality; iv) predicative use. We believe that the genitive of quality, like adjectives (see section 2.1), is an adjunct in the noun phrase. Unlike the adjective, however, the structure of the genitive of quality does not contain an agreement head `adjP`, which is why we do not observe feature agreement with the head noun.

In the following examples, we see wh-extraction with genitives of quality:

(768) (internet)
a. `Kakogo rosta vam nravyatsya muzhchiny?`
   'What height of men do you like?'
b. `Kakogo vida parallelogramm mozhet byt' v osnovanii piramidy?`
   'What kind of parallelogram can be at the base of a pyramid?'
c. `Kakogo tsveta vybrat' postel'noye bel'ye?`
   'What color bedding to choose?'

Here, genitives of quality containing interrogative elements undergo extraposition. In the examples above, the entire constituent containing the genitive of quality is extracted. If we try to extract a single wh-word (cf.: `Kakiye vam nravyatsya muzhchiny?` 'What men do you like?' etc.), the examples become ungrammatical:

(769)
a. * `Kakogo vam nravyatsya muzhchiny rosta?`
   '*What you like men height?'
b. * `Kakogo parallelogramm vida mozhet byt' v osnovanii piramidy?`
   '*What parallelogram kind can be at the base of a pyramid?'
c. * `Kakogo vybrat' postel'noye bel'ye tsveta?`
   '*What choose bedding color?'

Wh-extraction is blocked by the fact that the genitive of quality is an adjunct and, therefore, constitutes an adjunct island (Testelec 2001: 543-552).

What is the status of the genitive of quality's projection? Unlike compound adjectives, it clearly has a phrasal level, but what kind? A possessive noun phrase can be replaced by a third-person pronoun referring to the possessor mentioned earlier in the discourse:

(770)
`kniga / brat / ruka Peti` → `yego kniga / brat / ruka`
'Petya's book / brother / hand' → 'his book / brother / hand'

In the case of the genitive of quality, replacement of the entire projection with a DP-category pronoun is impossible:

(771)
a. `ogromnoy sily udar` - `depressivnogo polya` → * `yeyo udar`
   'a blow of enormous force' - 'of a depressive field' → '*her blow'
b. `shkura sizogo tsveta` → * `yego shkura`
   'a bluish-gray hide' → '*his hide'

The following examples demonstrate that genitives of quality (in contrast to possessives) cannot be replaced by DP-status pronouns during relativization:

(772)
a. * `Ya voskhishchalsya nebyvaloy krasotoy, devushku kotoroy vchera vstretil.`
   '*I admired extraordinary beauty, whose girl I met yesterday.'
a′. `Ya voskhishchalsya devushkoy, muzha kotoroy vchera vstretil.`
    'I admired the girl whose husband I met yesterday.'
b. * `Obshchepriznano vysokoye kachestvo, tovary kotorogo vypuskayutsya v Finlyandii.`
   '*It is generally recognized high quality, whose goods are produced in Finland.'
b′. `Bylo zakryto predpriyatiye, tovary kotorogo priznany vrednymi.`
    'An enterprise whose goods were deemed harmful was closed down.'

From this, it follows that the genitive of quality represents a nominal projection smaller than DP.

## 4.4.4. Internal Structure of the Genitive of Quality

Noun phrases that are genitives of quality can contain two (see above) or more elements, including coordinated ones:

(773) (internet)
a. `Krome togo, nikto ne somnevayetsya, chto eto rabota vysshego mezhdunarodnogo klassa.`
   'Moreover, no one doubts that this is a work of the highest international class.'
b. `Izgotovleniye reznykh predmetov inter'yera lyuboy slozhnosti po eskizam zakazchika iz massiva krasnogo i belogo dereva.`
   'Manufacture of carved interior items of any complexity according to customer's sketches from solid red and white wood.'

Adjective modifiers are extremely frequent, typically associated with expressing various degrees of feature manifestation:

(774) (internet)
a. `svisayet so svoda odinokiy stalaktit ves'ma neobychnogo krasnogo tsveta`
   'a single stalactite of a very unusual red color hangs from the vault'
b. `kakiye-to neozhidanno intelligentnogo vida lyudi v shtatskom, s borodami, otsvechivayushchiy mech samogo zlovishchego vida`
   'some unexpectedly intelligent-looking people in civilian clothes, with beards, a gleaming sword of the most sinister appearance'
c. `Gnusnogo vida belesyye sosul'ki svisali so shlangov i s krayev yashchika, na potolke krasovalis' zhurnyye, ne meneye gnusnogo vida pyatna.`
   'Vile-looking whitish icicles hung from hoses and the edges of the box; greasy, no less vile-looking stains adorned the ceiling.'
e. `Stikhov takoy porazitel'noy sily yeshche ne znala russkaya poeziya.`
   'Russian poetry had not yet known poems of such astonishing power.'

An interesting question is whether adjectives — the "obligatory third element" — can be replaced by another dependent. Possibly, in some cases (marginally), genitives of quality can be formed with the participation of an "obligatory third genitive":

(775) (internet)
a. `glaza tsveta kofe`
   'eyes the color of coffee'
b. `Internet-magazin Osram predlagayet kupit' filamentnyye lampy formy shara.`
   'The Osram online store offers filament lamps in the shape of a sphere.'

In most cases, however, a second genitive appears doubtful even for relational nouns that have lexical valence:

(776) (internet)
`Eto byl pylkiy, l'vinoy otvagi i sily voin.`
'He was a fiery warrior of lion-like courage and strength.'

(777)
?? `voin sily l'va`
   '?? warrior of strength of lion'
?? `voin otvagi l'va`
   '?? warrior of courage of lion'

Double genitives become unequivocally acceptable when the dependent noun acquires a modifying adjective:

(778) (internet)
a. `V nashem internet-magazine vy mozhete kupit' plat'ye tsveta morskoy volny.`
   'In our online store, you can buy a dress the color of a sea wave.'
b. `Plod - lozhnaya yagoda s odnim semenem, formy vytyanutogo shara.`
   'The fruit is a false berry with one seed, in the shape of an elongated sphere.'

Formations with numerals, quantifying words like `mnogo` ('many'), etc., and modifiers like `raznyy` ('different') appear ungrammatical:

(779)
a. `stosil'nyy dvigatel'`
   'hundred-horsepower engine'
a′. * `dvigatel' sta sil`
    '*engine of a hundred forces'
b. `mnogogrannyy chelovek`
   'multi-faceted person'
b′. * `chelovek mnogikh graney`
    '*person of many facets'
c. `raznostoronnyaya lichnost'`
   'versatile personality'
c′. * `lichnost' raznykh storon`
    '*personality of different sides'

The facts presented suggest that the genitive of quality allows the dependent noun to be modified only by an adjective or (in the case of relational nouns) by a dependent genitive with an adjective. Both adjectives and relational nouns attach to the minimal level of lexical projection, NP.

Thus, the Russian genitive of quality is a non-agreeing adjunct, whose position and use, as is often the case with adjunction, are quite free. Such an adjunct can be located before or after the head noun, can be coordinated with adjectives, and can precede them. The genitive of quality is an NP-level projection, as "high" modifiers are unavailable to it, and it cannot be replaced by DP-proforms.

## 4.4.5. Analysis: The Genitive of Quality as an Analogue of Compound Adjectives

Below, we will propose an analysis of the structure of the genitive of quality and answer the following important questions: i) why the genitive of quality has the meaning of a feature or property; ii) why the presence of an adjective is critical for the formation of the genitive of quality.

Thus, when an internal nominal projection is present, genitives of quality have the external distribution and semantics of adjectives. The nominal structure projected by the head noun (`tsvet` 'color', `rost` 'height', `sila` 'strength', …) does not determine the external syntactic function of the constituent.

We believe that genitives of quality, like many of the cases discussed above, have the nature of a complex attribute. Their difference from formations like `trudnodostupnyy` ('hard-to-reach') or `voyennokosmicheskiy` ('military-space') is that genitives of quality do not contain recategorizing morphology. Units like `trudnodostupnyy` or `voyennokosmicheskiy` are formed with the participation of adjectivizing or attributivizing morphemes. As a consequence, they become lexicon units with corresponding properties. The adjectivizing suffix `-n` allows the formation of short forms (`trudnodostupen` 'hard-to-reach.SF', …), comparatives (`trudnodostupneye` 'harder to reach') etc. The attributivizer `-sk` enables the new unit to be used attributively. In both cases, however, new lexicon elements are formed.

Genitives of quality, like adjectives, specify a feature. This feature can be gradable or discrete – this depends on the lexemes that compose the genitive of quality, cf.:

(780) (internet)
`Muzhchiny boleye vysokogo rosta vosprinimayutsya okruzhayushchimi kak boleye talantlivyye…`
'Men of taller stature are perceived by others as more talented…'

(781)
* `mebel' boleye karel'skoy berezy`
  '*more Karelian birch furniture'

As for their syntactic status, genitives of quality are not lexicon units. This is evident, for example, from the fact that the prohibition on the presence of no more than two elements, which is relevant for other types of Russian composites, is irrelevant for them, see (Grashchenkov 2016), cf. `ves'ma neobychnogo krasnogo tsveta` ('of very unusual red color') etc.

We believe that the typologically universal attributive head A is responsible for the distribution of genitives of quality, which is analogous to that of adjectives:

(782)
<!-- image -->

The genitive of quality, therefore, has the status of a noun phrase embedded in an A-projection, which is responsible for attributive use (adjunction).

Such a structure has close analogues in Dagestanian languages; for instance, in Bagvalal:

(783) Bagvalal
a. `miča r=eč’at’u=j jaš`
   hair N.PL=black=F girl
   'black-haired girl'
b. `r=eč’at’u=r mičał jaš`
   N.PL=black=N.PL hair-GEN girl
   'black-haired girl' (= 'girl of black hair')

Example (a) presents a case we analyzed in section 4.2. The structure of example (b) precisely replicates the syntax of the Russian genitive of quality. The adjective of the dependent noun phrase agrees with its head, and the means of subordinating the entire dependent projection is the genitive. In this case, the entire projection has the status of an attribute, while leaving its internal syntax intact.

The Russian genitive of quality has a surface syntax analogous to the Bagvalal case (b) and a deep structure of type (a). In the case of the Russian genitive of quality, the complex constituent's structure contains an A head, which is why it is used attributively. At the same time, it lacks an `adjP` head, which is necessary for expressing agreement.

Thus, the meaning of a feature or property in the case of the Russian genitive of quality is a consequence of the presence of the head A. Let us address the question of why an adjective is necessary in such constructions. In reality, it is not "necessary." It is simply that the only context where we can observe the genitive of quality is the context of a complex constituent. It is precisely and only this constituent, and not a single noun, that can combine with the A head. In this respect, the phonologically unexpressed A head is analogous to the zero head Adj, which marks complex stems with a body part as the head, cf.: `[ dv-ukryl ]-Ø-yy` ('two-winged'), `[ dlinn-o-nog ]-Ø-iy` ('long-legged'), `[ kar-e-glaz ]]-Ø-yy` ('brown-eyed'), cf. *`kryl-Ø-yy` ('*winged'), *`nog-Ø-iy` ('*legged'), *`glaz-Ø-yy` ('*eyed').

The formation of the genitive of quality is analogous to the derivation of compound adjectives. In the case of the genitive of quality, two or more units combine into a minimal projection of a noun phrase, which is marked by the head A:

(784)
`[ AP A [ NP [ vysok ] rost ]]`

In the case of compound adjectives, two combined stems are marked by a derivational marker:

(785)
`[ Adj -n [[ vysok ] skorost ]]`

The second path of derivation yields the compound adjective `vysokoskorostnoy` ('high-speed'), while the first yields the minimal nominal projection `vysokogo rosta` ('of high height'). Since such a projection is not formed in the lexicon, its elements can — and indeed must — acquire all relevant morphological features, i.e., agree in gender, number, and case.

Let us say a few words about the source of the genitive case feature, which is then transmitted to all elements comprising the genitive of quality. As we assume, genitive marking here arises from two factors: the so-called Case Filter and the rules of syntactic organization of the nominal projection.

In accordance with the Case Filter (Chomsky 1981), every phonologically realized noun phrase must receive case; see also the evolution of this idea in (Lyutikova 2017a). No noun phrase, therefore, can be realized without a case feature being assigned to it. According to our hypothesis, the projection of the genitive of quality is an adjunct. The genitive value of the case feature is thus assigned in the same way as the accusative is assigned to verb phrase adjuncts in cases like `Ya prozhdal yeyo dva chasa {ACC}` ('I waited for her for two hours {ACC}') and so on.

## 4.4.6. Summary: The Attributive Nature of the Genitive of Quality

Thus, despite their status as a nominal projection and the presence of a genitive case feature, genitives of quality behave like adjectives (and not like possessive and other types of genitives). Due to their adjunct nature, they can be positioned both to the left and to the right of the noun, coordinate with adjectives, and be used predicatively. Semantically, they denote properties and represent the minimal level of nominal projection — NP.

We have established that genitives of quality are a projection with nominal morphology and the syntax and semantics of an adjective. They are formed as a result of the combination of a nominal projection and an A head, which is responsible for attributive use.

## Conclusion

The idea I presented in the first chapter and tried to prove further is that adjectives can be realized in a language in one of two ways: as adjectivals or as attributives. The feature space of the adjective category is organized as follows: Both adjectivals and attributives form an attributive projection, including an attributive head A: [A [Adj/Atr]]. If the language exhibits agreement in the noun phrase, an agreement head `adjP` is built above this projection: [`adjP` [A [Adj/Atr]]]. The possibilities of the categorical feature Atr are exhausted by this; (lexical) attributives have no other properties.

The categorical feature Adj and its corresponding head possess a richer combinatorial arsenal. The Adj head can project structures including a comparative degree marker: [Deg [Adj]]. The adjectival projection can also include a `res` head, which marks the predicative use of adjectivals: [`resP` [Adj]]. The `res` projection is responsible for the eventive interpretation of the state conveyed by the adjective. The `res` head can be built above an adjectival Adj projection or – if, for example, we are dealing with a language with statives ("a language without adjectives") – above the verbal category V, i.e., above "adjective-statives": [`resP` [V]]. In both cases, the heads of lexical projections (Adj or V) have the ability to project a subject participant into syntax – this is confirmed by the properties of Russian short and full forms, Ossetian complex predicates, and English resultatives.

It is generally accepted that adjectives are elements incapable of projecting a specifier (= having their own subject). Contrary to this view, I have argued that adjective-adjectivals can contain the subject of states conveyed by adjectives in the specifier position. Adopting this view allows us to explain the prohibition on Russian predicative full forms with a complement, the asymmetric distribution of nominal and adjectival complex predicates in Ossetian, and a number of other facts.

Both variants of the categorical feature, Adj and Atr, are linked to the functional A-projection, responsible for their use as modifiers. The category of adjective, I believe, is nothing more than the grammaticalization of the attributive head A. In some languages, such grammaticalization leads to the emergence of adjectivals, in others – attributives. Languages like Russian have both "varieties" of adjectives. Languages with adjective-statives represent a case where the grammaticalization of the A head has not gone far enough for a separate layer of lexicon to be associated with it. Typologically and diachronically, "first candidates for adjectivals" are represented by semantic groups of SIZE, EVALUATION, COLOR, TIME, and some others. The classes of MATERIAL, NATIONALITY, PLACE, etc., are correspondingly grammaticalized into attributives.

When discussing adjectives, I tried to avoid the terms "qualitative" and "relational." The subdivision of adjectives into these two types, as I tried to show, corresponds to two different typological patterns and two different syntactic structures. The fundamental result here is that the division into adjectivals (~ qualitative adjectives) and attributives (~ relational adjectives) has a grammatical, not a semantic, nature. If one attempts to develop these generalizations, qualitative adjectives can be equated with (stative) verbs, and relational ones with nouns. Adjectives, therefore, can be either verbal or nominal. Perhaps such a "definition by negation" approaches M. Baker's approach and similar systems. The difference in my approach, however, is that adjectives can be considered a positively defined grammatical class. In other words, in a given language's lexicon, there can be units marked as {Adj} and/or {Atr}, and not only {+V,-N} or {-V,+N}.

Furthermore, the idea that all roots enter derivation without a lexical category feature is not supported by empirical facts. This is evident from the peculiarities of derivation of completely different structures, such as Ossetian complex predicates or Russian compound adjectives. Membership in the N, V, Adj classes, I believe, is a property of the root. In the process of derivation, the categorical label can change. Syntax must operate only with units whose categorical affiliation is "known" to it – this is related to principles of projection, syntactic selection, etc. The unsuitability of acategorial roots for derivation was observed, for example, with those stems borrowed into Russian. Despite the fact that in the source language they were already adjectives (`normal` etc.), they must be marked with Russian adjectivizing markers (`normal'-n-yy` etc.). One possible consequence, which we did not specifically discuss, is that the specifier position in structures with derivational markers like `-n` is projected by these markers themselves, which effectively represent the Adj head.

We have seen that adjectives – or rather, the meanings that correspond to adjectivals – can form projections of category Adj or V. In languages where adjectivals belong to category Adj, they are deprived of a number of possibilities associated with the projection of category V. For example, they cannot attach a direct object or receive aspectual-temporal markers. On the other hand, even in languages where adjectivals belong to category V, they are usually distinguished from other elements of this category by their ability to form degrees of comparison. Thus, there are grammatical and semantic properties of adjectivals. Grammatical properties – membership in Adj or V and all that follows from it – are not universal. Semantic properties are determined by lexical meaning and can coincide for the same elements both in "languages with adjectives" and in "languages without adjectives."

The choice between adjectives and statives for a given language can be likened to the choice of means for encoding locative relations. A language may use prepositions or postpositions to denote different types of localization, like Russian or Turkic languages (respectively). On the other hand, a language can choose a strategy involving a large number of local cases, like Finnish or Dagestanian languages. Both systems possess the same expressive capacity and can replace each other diachronically.

The typologically universal A head can have various manifestations. In particular, it can underlie the attributivization of constituents in various languages. The attributivization of constituents can only occur with the participation of the A head. As I tried to show, one such example is the Russian genitive of quality. The attributivization of complex units, phrases, or lexical complexes can also be marked with morphology (both derivational and inflectional), usually associated with adjectives. One possible consequence of this is the refutation of the cartographic hypothesis that certain semantic classes correspond to specific projection levels of the noun phrase. Such derivatives rather support the adjunct nature of adjective use in noun phrases. The relative "flexibility" of attribute order in the noun phrase also testifies to this.

The Russian language received special attention in this book. The uniqueness of the Russian adjective lies in the very wide range of phenomena from different linguistic levels associated with it. I tried to illuminate only a small part of the grammar of Russian adjectives. Interesting questions, such as the syntax of comparative constructions or the similarity of distributional properties of adjectives and participles, I am forced to leave for the future.

However, I managed to touch upon some specific problems of Russian adjectives. In particular, I tried to construct an exhaustive taxonomy of adjective government models. The order of adjectives within the noun phrase was also discussed, and the question of adjective use in nominal predication in Russian was investigated. In the latter case, the adjective is "attributive" only in the sense that a special form is used, which is attributive by nature and capable, even when used predicatively, of referring to the structure of the noun phrase. The noun phrase projection itself is absent in Russian predications with an adjective head.

The most important result for me was the study of the word form structure of short and full forms of adjectives. I tried to show that the full form of adjectivals has the structure [`adjP` [AP [Adj]]], i.e., it contains a universal attributive head A and an agreement projection `adjP`. The full form of adjectivals can be projected by an adjectival head Adj and, as a consequence, can have an internal subject: [`adjP` [AP [Adj Su [Adj]]]]. In parallel, there exist homonymous attributive forms. The specifier position of attributives cannot insert an argument or assign a semantic role. It is the second, attributive word form that is used in nominal predication with an adjective, which affects, for example, the difference in interpretation.

The short form of Russian adjectivals is close to the verb in its internal structure. It corresponds to the structure [`adjK` [`resP` [Adj]]]. The resultative head `res` participates in the projection of the short form of the adjective – a hypothesis that, of course, requires further detailed elaboration. One possible view on the nature of the `res` projection assumes its connection to the lexical semantics of the stative stem over which it is built. Such an approach brings adjectival statives (`Sup gotov` 'The soup is ready') closer to telic verbs (`Masha svarila sup` 'Masha cooked the soup' – `sup priobrel sostoyaniye 'byt' svarennym'` 'the soup acquired the state of 'being cooked''). Both stems can belong to different lexical classes but be connected to the `res` projection. Typologically, such a structure is realized in stative "languages without adjectives" and languages with complex predicates like Ossetian.
